\section{Introduction for students}\label{sec:intro-for-students}}

This book assumes no prerequisites: no algebra, no calculus, and no prior programming/coding experience. This is intended to be a gentle introduction to the practice of analyzing data and answering questions using data the way data scientists, statisticians, data journalists, and other researchers would.

In Figure \ref{fig:moderndive-figure} we present a flowchart of what you'll cover in this book. You'll first get started with data in Chapter \ref{getting-started}, where you'll learn about the difference between R and RStudio, start coding in R, understand what R packages are, and explore your first dataset: all domestic departure flights from a New York City airport in 2013. Then

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Data science}: You'll assemble your data science toolbox using \texttt{tidyverse} packages. In particular:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ch.\ref{viz}: Visualizing data via the \texttt{ggplot2} package.
  \item
    Ch.\ref{tidy}: Understanding the concept of ``tidy'' data as a standardized data input format for all packages in the \texttt{tidyverse}
  \item
    Ch.\ref{wrangling}: Wrangling data via the \texttt{dplyr} package.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Data modeling}: Using these data science tools and helper functions from the \texttt{moderndive} package, you'll start performing data modeling. In particular:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ch.\ref{regression}: Constructing basic regression models.
  \item
    Ch.\ref{multiple-regression}: Constructing multiple regression models.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Statistical inference}: Once again using your newly acquired data science tools, we'll unpack statistical inference using the \texttt{infer} package. In particular:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ch.\ref{sampling}: Understanding the role that sampling variability plays in statistical inference using both tactile and virtual simulations of sampling from a ``bowl'' with an unknown proportion of red balls.
  \item
    Ch.\ref{confidence-intervals}: Building confidence intervals.
  \item
    Ch.\ref{hypothesis-testing}: Conducting hypothesis tests.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Data modeling revisited}: Armed with your new understanding of statistical inference, you'll revisit and review the models you constructed in Ch.\ref{regression} \& Ch.\ref{multiple-regression}. In particular:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ch.\ref{inference-for-regression}: Interpreting both the statistical and practice significance of the results of the models.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

We'll end with a discussion on what it means to ``think with data'' in Chapter \ref{thinking-with-data} and present an example case study data analysis of house prices in Seattle.

\hypertarget{subsec:learning-goals}{%
\subsection{What you will learn from this book}\label{subsec:learning-goals}}

We hope that by the end of this book, you'll have learned

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How to use R to explore data.\\
\item
  How to answer statistical questions using tools like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.
\item
  How to effectively create ``data stories'' using these tools.
\end{enumerate}

What do we mean by data stories? We mean any analysis involving data that engages the reader in answering questions with careful visuals and thoughtful discussion, such as \href{http://rpubs.com/ry_lisa_elana/chicago}{How strong is the relationship between per capita income and crime in Chicago neighborhoods?} and \href{https://ismayc.github.io/soc301_s2017/group_projects/group4.html}{How many f**ks does Quentin Tarantino give (as measured by the amount of swearing in his films)?}. Further discussions on data stories can be found in this \href{https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/tell-meaningful-stories-with-data/}{Think With Google article}.

For other examples of data stories constructed by students like yourselves, look at the final projects for two courses that have previously used ModernDive:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Middlebury College \href{https://rudeboybert.github.io/MATH116/PS/final_project/final_project_outline.html\#past_examples}{MATH 116 Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences} using student collected data.
\item
  Pacific University \href{https://ismayc.github.io/soc301_s2017/group-projects/index.html}{SOC 301 Social Statistics} using data from the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html}{fivethirtyeight R package}.
\end{itemize}

This book will help you develop your ``data science toolbox'', including tools such as data visualization, data formatting, data wrangling, and data modeling using regression. With these tools, you'll be able to perform the entirety of the ``data/science pipeline'' while building data communication skills (see Subsection \ref{subsec:pipeline} for more details).

In particular, this book will lean heavily on data visualization. In today's world, we are bombarded with graphics that attempt to convey ideas. We will explore what makes a good graphic and what the standard ways are to convey relationships with data. You'll also see the use of visualization to introduce concepts like mean, median, standard deviation, distributions, etc. In general, we'll use visualization as a way of building almost all of the ideas in this book.

To impart the statistical lessons in this book, we have intentionally minimized the number of mathematical formulas used and instead have focused on developing a conceptual understanding via data visualization, statistical computing, and simulations. We hope this is a more intuitive experience than the way statistics has traditionally been taught in the past and how it is commonly perceived.

Finally, you'll learn the importance of literate programming. By this we mean you'll learn how to write code that is useful not just for a computer to execute but also for readers to understand exactly what your analysis is doing and how you did it. This is part of a greater effort to encourage reproducible research (see Subsection \ref{subsec:reproducible} for more details). Hal Abelson coined the phrase that we will follow throughout this book:

\begin{quote}
``Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.''
\end{quote}

We understand that there may be challenging moments as you learn to program. Both of us continue to struggle and find ourselves often using web searches to find answers and reach out to colleagues for help. In the long run though, we all can solve problems faster and more elegantly via programming. We wrote this book as our way to help you get started and you should know that there is a huge community of R users that are always happy to help everyone along as well. This community exists in particular on the internet on various forums and websites such as \href{https://stackoverflow.com/}{stackoverflow.com}.

\hypertarget{subsec:pipeline}{%
\subsection{Data/science pipeline}\label{subsec:pipeline}}

You may think of statistics as just being a bunch of numbers. We commonly hear the phrase ``statistician'' when listening to broadcasts of sporting events. Statistics (in particular, data analysis), in addition to describing numbers like with baseball batting averages, plays a vital role in all of the sciences. You'll commonly hear the phrase ``statistically significant'' thrown around in the media. You'll see articles that say ``Science now shows that chocolate is good for you.'' Underpinning these claims is data analysis. By the end of this book, you'll be able to better understand whether these claims should be trusted or whether we should be wary. Inside data analysis are many sub-fields that we will discuss throughout this book (though not necessarily in this order):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  data collection
\item
  data wrangling
\item
  data visualization
\item
  data modeling
\item
  inference
\item
  correlation and regression
\item
  interpretation of results
\item
  data communication/storytelling
\end{itemize}

These sub-fields are summarized in what Grolemund and Wickham term the \href{http://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html}{``Data/Science Pipeline''} in Figure \ref{fig:pipeline-figure}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/tidy1} 

}

\caption{Data/Science Pipeline}\label{fig:pipeline-figure}
\end{figure}

We will begin by digging into the gray \textbf{Understand} portion of the cycle with data visualization, then with a discussion on what is meant by tidy data and data wrangling, and then conclude by talking about interpreting and discussing the results of our models via \textbf{Communication}. These steps are vital to any statistical analysis. But why should you care about statistics? ``Why did they make me take this class?''

There's a reason so many fields require a statistics course. Scientific knowledge grows through an understanding of statistical significance and data analysis. You needn't be intimidated by statistics. It's not the beast that it used to be and, paired with computation, you'll see how reproducible research in the sciences particularly increases scientific knowledge.

\hypertarget{subsec:reproducible}{%
\subsection{Reproducible research}\label{subsec:reproducible}}

\begin{quote}
``The most important tool is the \emph{mindset}, when starting, that the end product will be reproducible.'' -- Keith Baggerly
\end{quote}

Another goal of this book is to help readers understand the importance of reproducible analyses. The hope is to get readers into the habit of making their analyses reproducible from the very beginning. This means we'll be trying to help you build new habits. This will take practice and be difficult at times. You'll see just why it is so important for you to keep track of your code and well-document it to help yourself later and any potential collaborators as well.

Copying and pasting results from one program into a word processor is not the way that efficient and effective scientific research is conducted. It's much more important for time to be spent on data collection and data analysis and not on copying and pasting plots back and forth across a variety of programs.

In a traditional analyses if an error was made with the original data, we'd need to step through the entire process again: recreate the plots and copy and paste all of the new plots and our statistical analysis into your document. This is error prone and a frustrating use of time. We'll see how to use R Markdown to get away from this tedious activity so that we can spend more time doing science.

\begin{quote}
``We are talking about \emph{computational} reproducibility.'' - Yihui Xie
\end{quote}

Reproducibility means a lot of things in terms of different scientific fields. Are experiments conducted in a way that another researcher could follow the steps and get similar results? In this book, we will focus on what is known as \textbf{computational reproducibility}. This refers to being able to pass all of one's data analysis, data-sets, and conclusions to someone else and have them get exactly the same results on their machine. This allows for time to be spent interpreting results and considering assumptions instead of the more error prone way of starting from scratch or following a list of steps that may be different from machine to machine.

\hypertarget{final-note-for-students}{%
\subsection{Final note for students}\label{final-note-for-students}}

At this point, if you are interested in instructor perspectives on this book, ways to contribute and collaborate, or the technical details of this book's construction and publishing, then continue with the rest of the chapter below. Otherwise, let's get started with R and RStudio in Chapter \ref{getting-started}!

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{sec:intro-instructors}{%
\section{Introduction for instructors}\label{sec:intro-instructors}}

This book is inspired by the following books:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R'' \citep{hester2011},
\item
  ``OpenIntro: Intro Stat with Randomization and Simulation'' \citep{isrs2014}, and
\item
  ``R for Data Science'' \citep{rds2016}.
\end{itemize}

The first book, while designed for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students, provides an excellent resource on how to use resampling to impart statistical concepts like sampling distributions using computation instead of large-sample approximations and other mathematical formulas. The last two books are free options to learning introductory statistics and data science, providing an alternative to the many traditionally expensive introductory statistics textbooks.

When looking over the large number of introductory statistics textbooks that currently exist, we found that there wasn't one that incorporated many newly developed R packages directly into the text, in particular the many packages included in the \href{http://tidyverse.org/}{\texttt{tidyverse}} collection of packages, such as \texttt{ggplot2}, \texttt{dplyr}, \texttt{tidyr}, and \texttt{broom}. Additionally, there wasn't an open-source and easily reproducible textbook available that exposed new learners all of three of the learning goals listed at the outset of Subsection \ref{subsec:learning-goals}.

\hypertarget{who-is-this-book-for}{%
\subsection{Who is this book for?}\label{who-is-this-book-for}}

This book is intended for instructors of traditional introductory statistics classes using RStudio, either the desktop or server version, who would like to inject more data science topics into their syllabus. We assume that students taking the class will have no prior algebra, calculus, nor programming/coding experience.

Here are some principles and beliefs we kept in mind while writing this text. If you agree with them, this might be the book for you.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Blur the lines between lecture and lab}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    With increased availability and accessibility of laptops and open-source non-proprietary statistical software, the strict dichotomy between lab and lecture can be loosened.
  \item
    It's much harder for students to understand the importance of using software if they only use it once a week or less. They forget the syntax in much the same way someone learning a foreign language forgets the rules. Frequent reinforcement is key.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Focus on the entire data/science research pipeline}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We believe that the entirety of Grolemund and Wickham's \href{http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html}{data/science pipeline} should be taught.
  \item
    We believe in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05346}{``minimizing prerequisites to research''}: students should be answering questions with data as soon as possible.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{It's all about the data}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We leverage R packages for rich, real, and realistic data-sets that at the same time are easy-to-load into R, such as the \texttt{nycflights13} and \texttt{fivethirtyeight} packages.
  \item
    We believe that \href{http://escholarship.org/uc/item/84v3774z}{data visualization is a gateway drug for statistics} and that the Grammar of Graphics as implemented in the \texttt{ggplot2} package is the best way to impart such lessons. However, we often hear: ``You can't teach \texttt{ggplot2} for data visualization in intro stats!'' We, like \href{http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach_ggplot2_to_beginners/}{David Robinson}, are much more optimistic.
  \item
    \texttt{dplyr} has made data wrangling much more \href{http://chance.amstat.org/2015/04/setting-the-stage/}{accessible} to novices, and hence much more interesting data-sets can be explored.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Use simulation/resampling to introduce statistical inference, not probability/mathematical formulas}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Instead of using formulas, large-sample approximations, and probability tables, we teach statistical concepts using resampling-based inference.
  \item
    This allows for a de-emphasis of traditional probability topics, freeing up room in the syllabus for other topics.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Don't fence off students from the computation pool, throw them in!}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Computing skills are essential to working with data in the 21st century. Given this fact, we feel that to shield students from computing is to ultimately do them a disservice.
  \item
    We are not teaching a course on coding/programming per se, but rather just enough of the computational and algorithmic thinking necessary for data analysis.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Complete reproducibility and customizability}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We are frustrated when textbooks give examples, but not the source code and the data itself. We give you the source code for all examples as well as the whole book!
  \item
    Ultimately the best textbook is one you've written yourself. You know best your audience, their background, and their priorities. You know best your own style and the types of examples and problems you like best. Customization is the ultimate end.

DataCamp is a browser-based interactive platform for learning data science, offering courses on a wide array of courses on data science, analytics, statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, where each course is a combination of lectures and exercises that offer immediate feedback.

The following chapters of ModernDive roughly map to the following closely-integrated DataCamp courses that use the same R tools and often even the same datasets. By no means is this an exhaustive list of possible DataCamp courses that are relevant to the topics in this book, we recommend these ones in particular to supplement your ModernDive experience.

Click on the image for each course to access its webpage on \href{https://www.datacamp.com/home}{datacamp.com}. Instructors at accredited universities can sign their class up for a free academic licence at \href{https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education}{DataCamp For The Classroom}, giving their students access to all premium courses for 6 months for free.

\chapter{Getting Started with Data in R}\label{getting-started}}

Before we can start exploring data in R, there are some key concepts to understand first:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What are R and RStudio?
\item
  How do I code in R?
\item
  What are R packages?
\end{enumerate}

We'll introduce these concepts in upcoming Sections \ref{r-rstudio}-\ref{packages}. If you are already somewhat familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip to Section \ref{nycflights13} where we'll introduce our first data set: all domestic flights departing a New York City airport in 2013. This is a dataset we will explore in depth in this book.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{r-rstudio}{%
\section{What are R and RStudio?}\label{r-rstudio}}

For much of this book, we will assume that you are using R via RStudio. First time users often confuse the two. At its simplest:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  R is like a car's engine.
\item
  RStudio is like a car's dashboard.
\end{itemize}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}
\toprule
R: Engine & RStudio: Dashboard\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=1.7in]{images/engine.jpg} & \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=1.7in]{images/dashboard.jpg}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

More precisely, R is a programming language that runs computations while RStudio is an \emph{integrated development environment (IDE)} that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. So the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio's interface makes using R much easier as well.

If you are still not sure about the difference between R and RStudio IDE, we suggest you watch this \href{https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1/orientation?ex=1}{DataCamp video}.

\hypertarget{installing-r-and-rstudio}{%
\subsection{Installing R and RStudio}\label{installing-r-and-rstudio}}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Note about RStudio Server}: If your instructor has provided you with a link and access to RStudio Server, then you can skip this section. We do recommend though after a few months of working on the RStudio Server that you return to these instructions.
\end{quote}

You will first need to download and install both R and RStudio (Desktop version) on your computer.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{You must do this first:} \href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{Download and install R}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Click on the download link corresponding to your computer's operating system.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{You must do this second:} \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/}{Download and install RStudio}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Scroll down to ``Installers for Supported Platforms''
  \item
    Click on the download link corresponding to your computer's operating system.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

If you had trouble with these two steps, we suggest you watch this \href{https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1/orientation?ex=3}{DataCamp video}.

\hypertarget{using-r-via-rstudio}{%
\subsection{Using R via RStudio}\label{using-r-via-rstudio}}

Recall our car analogy from above. Much as we don't drive a car by interacting directly with the engine but rather by interacting with elements on the car's dashboard, we won't be using R directly but rather we will use RStudio's interface. After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you'll have two new programs AKA applications you can open. We will always work in RStudio and not R. In other words:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}
\toprule
R: Do not open this & RStudio: Open this\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/Rlogo.png} & \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/RStudio-Ball.png}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

After you open RStudio, you should see the following:

\includegraphics{images/rstudio.png}

Note the three panes, which are three panels dividing the screen: The \emph{Console pane}, the \emph{Files pane}, and the \emph{Environment pane}. Over the course of this chapter, you'll come to learn what purpose each of these panes serve.

If however you would like an in depth explanation right now however, we suggest you watch following \href{https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1/orientation?ex=5}{DataCamp video}.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{code}{%
\section{How do I code in R?}\label{code}}

Now that you're set up with R and RStudio, you are probably asking yourself ``OK. Now how do I use R?'' The first thing to note as that unlike other statistical software programs like Excel, STATA, or SAS that provide \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_and_click}{point and click} interfaces, R is an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language}{interpreted language}, meaning you have to enter in R commands written in R code. In other words, you have to code/program in R. Note that we'll use the terms ``coding'' and ``programming'' interchangeably in this book.

While it is not required to be a seasoned coder/computer programmer to use R, there is still a set of basic programming concepts that R users need to understand. Consequently, while this book is not a book on programming, you will still learn just enough of these basic programming concepts needed to explore and analyze data effectively.

\hypertarget{programming-concepts}{%
\subsection{Basic programming concepts and terminology}\label{programming-concepts}}

To introduce you to many of these basic programming concepts and terminology, we direct you to the following DataCamp online interactive tutorials. For each of the tutorials, we give a list of the basic programming concepts covered. Note that in this book, we will use a different font to distinguish regular font from \texttt{computer\_code}.

It is important to note that while these tutorials serve as excellent introductions, a single pass through them is insufficient for long-term learning and retention. The ultimate tools for long-term learning and retention are ``learning by doing'' and repetition, something we will have you do over the course of the entire book and we encourage this process as much as possible as you learn any new skill.

    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Testing for equality in R using \texttt{==} (and not \texttt{=} which is typically used for assignment). Ex: \texttt{2\ +\ 1\ ==\ 3} compares \texttt{2\ +\ 1} to \texttt{3} and is correct R syntax, while \texttt{2\ +\ 1\ =\ 3} is not and is incorrect R syntax.
    \item
      Boolean algebra: \texttt{TRUE/FALSE} statements and mathematical operators such as \texttt{\textless{}} (less than), \texttt{\textless{}=} (less than or equal), and \texttt{!=} (not equal to).
    \item
      Logical operators: \texttt{\&} representing ``and'', \texttt{\textbar{}} representing ``or''. Ex: \texttt{(2\ +\ 1\ ==\ 3)\ \&\ (2\ +\ 1\ ==\ 4)} returns \texttt{FALSE} while \texttt{(2\ +\ 1\ ==\ 3)\ \textbar{}\ (2\ +\ 1\ ==\ 4)} returns \texttt{TRUE}.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \href{https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r/chapter-3-functions?ex=1}{Chapter 3 Functions}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Concept of functions: they take in inputs (called \emph{arguments}) and return outputs.
    \item
      You either manually specify a function's arguments or use the function's \emph{defaults}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This list is by no means an exhaustive list of all the programming concepts and terminology needed to become a savvy R user; such a list would be so large it wouldn't be very useful, especially for novices. Rather, we feel this is the bare minimum you need to know before you get started; the rest we feel you can learn as you go. Remember that your knowledge of all of these concepts will build as you get better and better at ``speaking R'' and getting used to its syntax.

\hypertarget{errors-warnings-and-messages}{%
\subsection{Errors, warnings, and messages}\label{errors-warnings-and-messages}}

One slightly confusing part of R is how it reports errors, warnings, and messages. The default theme in RStudio colors errors, warnings, and messages in red, which makes them seem like you did something wrong. However, seeing red text in the console \emph{is not always bad.}

R will show red text in the console in three different situations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Errors}: When the red text is a legitimate error, it will be prefaced with ``Error in\ldots{}'' and try to explain what went wrong. Generally when there's an error, the code will not run. For example, as shown in Subsection \ref{package-use} below if you see \texttt{Error\ in\ ggplot(...)\ :\ could\ not\ find\ function\ "ggplot"}, it means that the \texttt{ggplot()} function is not accessible because the package was not loaded with \texttt{library(ggplot2)}, and thus you cannot use it.
\item
  \textbf{Warnings}: When the red text is a warning, it will be prefaced with ``Warning:'' and try to explain why there's a warning. Generally your code will still work, but with some caveats. For example, you see in Chapter \ref{viz} if you plot a scatterplot and one of the rows in your data frame is missing a value, you will see this warning: \texttt{Warning:\ Removed\ 1\ rows\ containing\ missing\ values\ (geom\_point)}. R will still make the scatterplot with all the remaining values, but it's warning you that one of the points isn't there.
\item
  \textbf{Messages}: When the red text doesn't start with either ``Error'' or ``Warning'', it's \emph{just a friendly message}. You'll see these messages when you load some packages like the \texttt{dplyr} package in Subsection \ref{package-loading} below, or when you read data saved in spreadsheet files with \texttt{read\_csv()} as you'll see in Chapter \ref{tidy}. These are helpful diagnostic messages and they don't stop your code from working.
\end{itemize}

Remember, when you see red text in the console, \emph{don't panic}. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the text starts with ``Error'', figure out what's causing it. {Think of errors as a red traffic light: something is wrong!}
\item
  If the text starts with ``Warning'', figure out if it's something to worry about. For instance, if you get a warning about missing values in a scatterplot and you know there are missing values, you're fine. If that's surprising, look at your data and see what's missing. {Think of warnings as a yellow traffic light: everything is working fine, but watch out/pay attention.}
\item
  Otherwise the text is just a message. Read it, wave back at R, and thank it for talking to you. {Think of messages as a green traffic light: everything is working fine.}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{tips-on-learning-to-code}{%
\subsection{Tips on learning to code}\label{tips-on-learning-to-code}}

Learning to code/program is very much like learning a foreign language, it can be very daunting and frustrating at first. Such frustrations are very common and it is very normal to feel discouraged as you learn. However just as with learning a foreign language, if you put in the effort and are not afraid to make mistakes, anybody can learn.

Here are a few useful tips to keep in mind as you learn to program:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Remember that computers are not actually that smart}: You may think your computer or smartphone are ``smart,'' but really people spent a lot of time and energy designing them to appear ``smart.'' Rather you have to tell a computer everything it needs to do. Furthermore the instructions you give your computer can't have any mistakes in them, nor can they be ambiguous in any way.
\item
  \textbf{Take the ``copy, paste, and tweak'' approach}: Especially when learning your first programming language, it is often much easier to taking existing code that you know works and modify it to suit your ends, rather than trying to write new code from scratch. We call this the \emph{copy, paste, and tweak} approach. So early on, we suggest not trying to write code from memory, but rather take existing examples we have provided you, then copy, paste, and tweak them to suit your goals. Don't be afraid to play around!
\item
  \textbf{The best way to learn to code is by doing}: Rather than learning to code for its own sake, we feel that learning to code goes much smoother when you have a goal in mind or when you are working on a particular project, like analyzing data that you are interested in.
\item
  \textbf{Practice is key}: Just as the only method to improving your foreign language skills is through practice, practice, and practice; so also the only method to improving your coding is through practice, practice, and practice. Don't worry however; we'll give you plenty of opportunities to do so!

\hypertarget{packages}{%
\section{What are R packages?}\label{packages}}

Another point of confusion with many new R users is the idea of an R package. R packages extend the functionality of R by providing additional functions, data, and documentation. They are written by a world-wide community of R users and can be downloaded for free from the internet. For example, among the many packages we will use in this book are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \texttt{ggplot2} package for data visualization in Chapter \ref{viz}.
\item
  The \texttt{dplyr} package for data wrangling in Chapter \ref{wrangling}.
\item
  The \texttt{moderndive} package that accompanies this book.
\item
  The \texttt{infer} package for ``tidy'' and transparent statistical inference in Chapters \ref{confidence-intervals}, \ref{hypothesis-testing}, and \ref{inference-for-regression}.
\end{itemize}

A good analogy for R packages is they are like apps you can download onto a mobile phone:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}
\toprule
R: A new phone & R Packages: Apps you can download\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=1.5in]{images/iphone.jpg} & \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=1.5in]{images/apps.jpg}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

So R is like a new mobile phone: while it has a certain amount of features when you use it for the first time, it doesn't have everything. R packages are like the apps you can download onto your phone from Apple's App Store or Android's Google Play.

Let's continue this analogy by considering the Instagram app for editing and sharing pictures. Say you have purchased a new phone and you would like to share a recent photo you have taken on Instagram. You need to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Install the app}: Since your phone is new and does not include the Instagram app, you need to download the app from either the App Store or Google Play. You do this once and you're set. You might do this again in the future any time there is an update to the app.
\item
  \emph{Open the app}: After you've installed Instagram, you need to open the app.
\end{enumerate}

Once Instagram is open on your phone, you can then proceed to share your photo with your friends and family. The process is very similar for using an R package. You need to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Install the package}: This is like installing an app on your phone. Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. Thus if you want to use a package for the first time, you need to install it first. Once you've installed a package, you likely won't install it again unless you want to update it to a newer version.
\item
  \emph{``Load'' the package}: ``Loading'' a package is like opening an app on your phone. Packages are not ``loaded'' by default when you start RStudio on your computer; you need to ``load'' each package you want to use every time you start RStudio.
\end{enumerate}

Let's now show you how to perform these two steps for the \texttt{ggplot2} package for data visualization.

\hypertarget{package-installation}{%
\subsection{Package installation}\label{package-installation}}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Note about RStudio Server}: If your instructor has provided you with a link and access to RStudio Server, you probably will not need to install packages, as they have likely been pre-installed for you by your instructor. That being said, it is still a good idea to know this process for later on when you are not using RStudio Server, but rather RStudio Desktop on your own computer.
\end{quote}

There are two ways to install an R package. For example, to install the \texttt{ggplot2} package:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Easy way}: In the Files pane of RStudio:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Click on the ``Packages'' tab
  \item
    Click on ``Install''
  \item
    Type the name of the package under ``Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):'' In this case, type \texttt{ggplot2}
  \item
    Click ``Install''\\
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=4in]{images/install_packages_easy_way.png}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Slightly harder way}: An alternative but slightly less convenient way to install a package is by typing \texttt{install.packages("ggplot2")} in the Console pane of RStudio and hitting enter. Note you must include the quotation marks.
\end{enumerate}

Much like an app on your phone, you only have to install a package once. However, if you want to update an already installed package to a newer version, you need to re-install it by repeating the above steps.

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC2.1)} Repeat the above installing steps, but for the \texttt{dplyr}, \texttt{nycflights13}, and \texttt{knitr} packages. This will install the earlier mentioned \texttt{dplyr} package, the \texttt{nycflights13} package containing data on all domestic flights leaving a NYC airport in 2013, and the \texttt{knitr} package for writing reports in R.

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

\hypertarget{package-loading}{%
\subsection{Package loading}\label{package-loading}}

Recall that after you've installed a package, you need to ``load'' it, in other words open it. We do this by using the \texttt{library()} command. For example, to load the \texttt{ggplot2} package, run the following code in the Console pane. What do we mean by ``run the following code''? Either type or copy \& paste the following code into the Console pane and then hit the enter key.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(ggplot2)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If after running the above code, a blinking cursor returns next to the \texttt{\textgreater{}} ``prompt'' sign, it means you were successful and the \texttt{ggplot2} package is now loaded and ready to use. If however, you get a red ``error message'' that reads\ldots{}

\begin{verbatim}
Error in library(ggplot2) : there is no package called ‘ggplot2’
\end{verbatim}

\ldots{} it means that you didn't successfully install it. In that case, go back to the previous subsection ``Package installation'' and install it.

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC2.2)} ``Load'' the \texttt{dplyr}, \texttt{nycflights13}, and \texttt{knitr} packages as well by repeating the above steps.

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

\hypertarget{package-use}{%
\subsection{Package use}\label{package-use}}

One extremely common mistake new R users make when wanting to use particular packages is they forget to ``load'' them first by using the \texttt{library()} command we just saw. Remember: \emph{you have to load each package you want to use every time you start RStudio.} If you don't first ``load'' a package, but attempt to use one of its features, you'll see an error message similar to:

\begin{verbatim}
Error: could not find function
\end{verbatim}

R is telling you that you are trying to use a function in a package that has not yet been ``loaded.'' Almost all new users forget do this when starting out, and it is a little annoying to get used. However, you'll remember with practice.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{nycflights13}{%
\section{Explore your first datasets}\label{nycflights13}}

Let's put everything we've learned so far into practice and start exploring some real data! Data comes to us in a variety of formats, from pictures to text to numbers. Throughout this book, we'll focus on datasets that are saved in ``spreadsheet''-type format; this is probably the most common way data are collected and saved in many fields. Remember from Subsection \ref{programming-concepts} that these ``spreadsheet''-type datasets are called \emph{data frames} in R; we will focus on working with data saved as data frames throughout this book.

Let's first load all the packages needed for this chapter, assuming you've already installed them. Read Section \ref{packages} for information on how to install and load R packages if you haven't already.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(nycflights13)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(dplyr)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(knitr)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

At the beginning of all subsequent chapters in this text, we'll always have a list of packages that you should have installed and loaded to work with that chapter's R code.

\hypertarget{nycflights13-package}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{nycflights13} package}{nycflights13 package}}\label{nycflights13-package}}

Many of us have flown on airplanes or know someone who has. Air travel has become an ever-present aspect in many people's lives. If you live in or are visiting a relatively large city and you walk around that city's airport, you see gates showing flight information from many different airlines. And you will frequently see that some flights are delayed because of a variety of conditions. Are there ways that we can avoid having to deal with these flight delays?

We'd all like to arrive at our destinations on time whenever possible. (Unless you secretly love hanging out at airports. If you are one of these people, pretend for the moment that you are very much anticipating being at your final destination.) Throughout this book, we're going to analyze data related to flights contained in the \texttt{nycflights13} package \citep{R-nycflights13}. Specifically, this package contains five data sets saved in five separate data frames with information about all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2013. These include Newark Liberty International (EWR), John F. Kennedy International (JFK), and LaGuardia (LGA) airports:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{flights}: Information on all 336,776 flights
\item
  \texttt{airlines}: A table matching airline names and their two letter IATA airline codes (also known as carrier codes) for 16 airline companies
\item
  \texttt{planes}: Information about each of 3,322 physical aircraft used.
\item
  \texttt{weather}: Hourly meteorological data for each of the three NYC airports. This data frame has 26,115 rows, roughly corresponding to the 365 \(\times\) 24 \(\times\) 3 = 26,280 possible hourly measurements one can observe at three locations over the course of a year.
\item
  \texttt{airports}: Airport names, codes, and locations for 1,458 destination airports.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{flights-data-frame}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{flights} data frame}{flights data frame}}\label{flights-data-frame}}

We will begin by exploring the \texttt{flights} data frame that is included in the \texttt{nycflights13} package and getting an idea of its structure. Run the following code in your console (either by typing it or cutting \& pasting it): it loads in the \texttt{flights} dataset into your Console. Note depending on the size of your monitor, the output may vary slightly.

\begin{Shaded}

#   flight <int>, tailnum <chr>, origin <chr>, dest <chr>,
#   air_time <dbl>, distance <dbl>, hour <dbl>, minute <dbl>,
#   time_hour <dttm>
\end{verbatim}

Let's unpack this output:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{A\ tibble:\ 336,776\ x\ 19}: A \texttt{tibble} is a kind of data frame used in R. This particular data frame has

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{336,776} rows
  \item
    \texttt{19} columns corresponding to 19 variables describing each observation
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{year\ month\ day\ dep\_time\ sched\_dep\_time\ dep\_delay\ arr\_time} are different columns, in other words variables, of this data frame.
\item
  We then have the first 10 rows of observations corresponding to 10 flights.
\item
  \texttt{...\ with\ 336,766\ more\ rows,\ and\ 11\ more\ variables:} indicating to us that 336,766 more rows of data and 11 more variables could not fit in this screen.
\end{itemize}

Unfortunately, this output does not allow us to explore the data very well. Let's look at different tools to explore data frames.

\hypertarget{exploredataframes}{%
\subsection{Exploring data frames}\label{exploredataframes}}

Among the many ways of getting a feel for the data contained in a data frame such as \texttt{flights}, we present three functions that take as their ``argument'', in other words their input, the data frame in question. We also include a fourth method for exploring one particular column of a data frame:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Using the \texttt{View()} function built for use in RStudio. We will use this the most.
\item
  Using the \texttt{glimpse()} function, which is included in the \texttt{dplyr} package.
\item
  Using the \texttt{kable()} function, which is included in the \texttt{knitr} package.
\item
  Using the \texttt{\$} operator to view a single variable in a data frame.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{1. \texttt{View()}}:

Run \texttt{View(flights)} in your Console in RStudio, either by typing it or cutting \& pasting it into the Console pane, and explore this data frame in the resulting pop-up viewer. You should get into the habit of always \texttt{View}ing any data frames that come your way. Note the capital ``V'' in \texttt{View}. R is case-sensitive so you'll receive an error is you run \texttt{view(flights)} instead of \texttt{View(flights)}.

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC2.3)} What does any \emph{ONE} row in this \texttt{flights} dataset refer to?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A. Data on an airline
\item
  B. Data on a flight
\item
  C. Data on an airport
\item
  D. Data on multiple flights
\end{itemize}

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

By running \texttt{View(flights)}, we see the different \emph{variables} listed in the columns and we see that there are different types of variables. Some of the variables like \texttt{distance}, \texttt{day}, and \texttt{arr\_delay} are what we will call \emph{quantitative} variables. These variables are numerical in nature. Other variables here are \emph{categorical}.

Note that if you look in the leftmost column of the \texttt{View(flights)} output, you will see a column of numbers. These are the row numbers of the dataset. If you glance across a row with the same number, say row 5, you can get an idea of what each row corresponds to. In other words, this will allow you to identify what object is being referred to in a given row. This is often called the \emph{observational unit}. The observational unit in this example is an individual flight departing New York City in 2013. You can identify the observational unit by determining what ``thing'' is being measured or described by each of the variables. We'll talk more about observational units in Section \ref{identification-vs-measurement-variables} on \emph{identification} and \emph{measurement} variables below.

\textbf{2. \texttt{glimpse()}}:

The second way to explore a data frame is using the \texttt{glimpse()} function included in the \texttt{dplyr} package. Thus, you can only use the \texttt{glimpse()} function after you've loaded the \texttt{dplyr} package. This function provides us with an alternative method for exploring a data frame than the \texttt{View()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{glimpse}\NormalTok{(flights)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

$ time_hour      <dttm> 2013-01-01 05:00:00, 2013-01-01 05:0...
\end{verbatim}

We see that \texttt{glimpse()} will give you the first few entries of each variable in a row after the variable. In addition, the \emph{data type} (see Subsection \ref{programming-concepts}) of the variable is given immediately after each variable's name inside \texttt{\textless{}\ \textgreater{}}. Here, \texttt{int} and \texttt{dbl} refer to ``integer'' and ``double'', which are computer coding terminology for quantitative/numerical variables. In contrast, \texttt{chr} refers to ``character'', which is computer terminology for text data. Text data, such as the \texttt{carrier} or \texttt{origin} of a flight, are categorical variables. The \texttt{time\_hour} variable is an example of one more type of data type: \texttt{dttm}. As you may suspect, this variable corresponds to a specific date and time of day. However, we won't work with dates in this class and leave it to a more advanced book on data science.

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC2.4)} What are some examples in this dataset of \textbf{categorical} variables? What makes them different than \textbf{quantitative} variables?

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

\textbf{3. \texttt{kable()}}:

The final way to explore the entirety of a data frame is using the \texttt{kable()} function from the \texttt{knitr} package. Let's explore the different carrier codes for all the airlines in our dataset two ways. Run both of these lines of code in your Console:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{airlines}
\KeywordTok{kable}\NormalTok{(airlines)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

At first glance, it may not appear that there is much difference in the outputs. However when using tools for document production such as \href{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html}{R Markdown}, the latter code produces output that is much more legible and reader-friendly.

\textbf{4. \texttt{\$} operator}

Lastly, the \texttt{\$} operator allows us to explore a single variable within a data frame. For example, run the following in your console

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{airlines}
\NormalTok{airlines}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{name}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We used the \texttt{\$} operator to extract only the \texttt{name} variable and return it as a vector of length 16. We will only be occasionally exploring data frames using this operator, instead favoring the \texttt{View()} and \texttt{glimpse()} functions.

\hypertarget{identification-vs-measurement-variables}{%
\subsection{Identification \& measurement variables}\label{identification-vs-measurement-variables}}

There is a subtle difference between the kinds of variables that you will encounter in data frames: \emph{identification variables} and \emph{measurement variables}. For example, let's explore the \texttt{airports} data frame by showing the output of \texttt{glimpse(airports)} below:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{glimpse}\NormalTok{(airports)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Observations: 1,458
Variables: 8
$ faa   <chr> "04G", "06A", "06C", "06N", "09J", "0A9", "0G6...
$ name  <chr> "Lansdowne Airport", "Moton Field Municipal Ai...
$ lat   <dbl> 41.1, 32.5, 42.0, 41.4, 31.1, 36.4, 41.5, 42.9...
$ lon   <dbl> -80.6, -85.7, -88.1, -74.4, -81.4, -82.2, -84....
$ alt   <int> 1044, 264, 801, 523, 11, 1593, 730, 492, 1000,...
$ tz    <dbl> -5, -6, -6, -5, -5, -5, -5, -5, -5, -8, -5, -6...
$ dst   <chr> "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "U", "...
$ tzone <chr> "America/New_York", "America/Chicago", "Americ...
\end{verbatim}

The variables \texttt{faa} and \texttt{name} are what we will call \emph{identification variables}: variables that uniquely identify each observational unit. They are mainly used to provide a unique name to each observational unit i.e.~row, thereby allowing us to uniquely identify them. \texttt{faa} gives the unique code provided by the FAA for that airport, while the \texttt{name} variable gives the longer more natural name of the airport. The remaining variables (\texttt{lat}, \texttt{lon}, \texttt{alt}, \texttt{tz}, \texttt{dst}, \texttt{tzone}) are often called \emph{measurement} or \emph{characteristic} variables: variables that describe properties of each observational unit, in other words each observation in each row. For example, \texttt{lat} and \texttt{long} describe the latitude and longitude of each airport.

Furthermore, sometimes a single variable might not be enough to uniquely identify each observational unit: combinations of variables might be needed. While it is not an absolute rule, for organizational purposes it is considered good practice to have your identification variables in the left-most columns of your data frame.

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC2.5)} What properties of the observational unit do each of \texttt{lat}, \texttt{lon}, \texttt{alt}, \texttt{tz}, \texttt{dst}, and \texttt{tzone} describe for the \texttt{airports} data frame? Note that you may want to use \texttt{?airports} to get more information.

\textbf{(LC2.6)} Provide the names of variables in a data frame with at least three variables in which one of them is an identification variable and the other two are not. In other words, create your own tidy data frame that matches these conditions.

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

\hypertarget{help-files}{%
\subsection{Help files}\label{help-files}}

Another nice feature of R is the help system. You can get help in R by entering a \texttt{?} before the name of a function or data frame in question and you will be presented with a page showing the documentation. For example, let's look at the help file for the \texttt{flights} data frame:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

We've given you what we feel are the most essential concepts to know before you can start exploring data in R. Is this chapter exhaustive? Absolutely not. To try to include everything in this chapter would make the chapter so large it wouldn't be useful!

If you are completely new to the world of coding, R, and RStudio and feel you could benefit from a more detailed introduction, we suggest you check out ModernDive co-author Chester Ismay's \href{https://rbasics.netlify.com/}{Getting used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown} short book \citep{usedtor2016}, which includes screencast recordings that you can follow along and pause as you learn. Furthermore, there is an introduction to R Markdown, a tool used for reproducible research in R.

As we stated earlier however, the best way to learn R is to learn by doing. We now start the ``data science'' portion of the book in Chapter \ref{viz} with what we feel is the most important tool in a data scientist's toolbox: data visualization. We will continue to explore the data included in the \texttt{nycflights13} package through data visualization. We'll see that data visualization is a powerful tool to add to our toolbox for data exploring that provides additional insight to what the \texttt{View()} and \texttt{glimpse()} functions can provide.

\chapter{Data Visualization}\label{viz}}

We begin the development of your data science toolbox with data visualization. By visualizing our data, we gain valuable insights that we couldn't initially see from just looking at the raw data in spreadsheet form. We will use the \texttt{ggplot2} package as it provides an easy way to customize your plots. \texttt{ggplot2} is rooted in the data visualization theory known as \emph{The Grammar of Graphics} \citep{wilkinson2005}.

At the most basic level, graphics/plots/charts (we use these terms interchangeably in this book) provide a nice way for us to get a sense for how quantitative variables compare in terms of their center (where the values tend to be located) and their spread (how they vary around the center). Graphics should be designed to emphasize the findings and insight you want your audience to understand. This does however require a balancing act. On the one hand, you want to highlight as many meaningful relationships and interesting findings as possible; on the other you don't want to include so many as to overwhelm your audience.

As we will see, plots/graphics also help us to identify patterns and outliers in our data. We will see that a common extension of these ideas is to compare the \emph{distribution} of one quantitative variable (i.e., what the spread of a variable looks like or how the variable is \emph{distributed} in terms of its values) as we go across the levels of a different categorical variable.

\section{The Grammar of Graphics}\label{grammarofgraphics}}

We begin with a discussion of a theoretical framework for data visualization known as ``The Grammar of Graphics,'' which serves as the foundation for the \texttt{ggplot2} package. Think of how we construct sentences in English to form sentences by combining different elements, like nouns, verbs, particles, subjects, objects, etc. However, we can't just combine these elements in any arbitrary order; we must do so following a set of rules known as a linguistic grammar. Similarly to a linguistic grammar, ``The Grammar of Graphics'' define a set of rules for constructing \emph{statistical graphics} by combining different types of \emph{layers}. This grammar was created by Leland Wilkinson \citep{wilkinson2005} and has been implemented in a variety of data visualization software including R.

\hypertarget{components-of-the-grammar}{%
\subsection{Components of the Grammar}\label{components-of-the-grammar}}

In short, the grammar tells us that:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{A statistical graphic is a \texttt{mapping} of \texttt{data} variables to \texttt{aes}thetic attributes of \texttt{geom}etric objects.}
\end{quote}

Specifically, we can break a graphic into the following three essential components:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{data}: the data set composed of variables that we map.
\item
  \texttt{geom}: the geometric object in question. This refers to the type of object we can observe in a plot. For example: points, lines, and bars.
\item
  \texttt{aes}: aesthetic attributes of the geometric object. For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size. Each assigned aesthetic attribute can be mapped to a variable in our data set.
\end{enumerate}

You might be wondering why we wrote the terms \texttt{data}, \texttt{geom}, and \texttt{aes} in a computer code type font. We'll see very shortly that we'll specify the elements of the grammar in R using these terms. However, let's first break down the grammar with an example.

\hypertarget{gapminder}{%
\subsection{Gapminder data}\label{gapminder}}

In February 2006, a statistician named Hans Rosling gave a TED talk titled \href{https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen}{``The best stats you've ever seen''} where he presented global economic, health, and development data from the website \href{http://www.gapminder.org/tools/\#_locale_id=en;\&chart-type=bubbles}{gapminder.org}. For example, for the 142 countries included from 2007, let's consider only the first 6 countries when listed alphabetically in Table \ref{tab:gapminder-2007}.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:gapminder-2007}Gapminder 2007 Data: First 6 of 142 countries}
\centering
\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont
\begin{tabular}{llrrr}
\toprule
Country & Continent & Life Expectancy & Population & GDP per Capita\\
\midrule
Afghanistan & Asia & 43.8 & 31889923 & 975\\
Albania & Europe & 76.4 & 3600523 & 5937\\
Algeria & Africa & 72.3 & 33333216 & 6223\\
Angola & Africa & 42.7 & 12420476 & 4797\\
Argentina & Americas & 75.3 & 40301927 & 12779\\
\addlinespace
Australia & Oceania & 81.2 & 20434176 & 34435\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Each row in this table corresponds to a country in 2007. For each row, we have 5 columns:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Country}: Name of country.
\item
  \textbf{Continent}: Which of the five continents the country is part of. (Note that ``Americas'' includes countries in both North and South America and that Antarctica is excluded.)
\item
  \textbf{Life Expectancy}: Life expectancy in years.
\item
  \textbf{Population}: Number of people living in the country.
\item
  \textbf{GDP per Capita}: Gross domestic product (in US dollars).
\end{enumerate}

Now consider Figure \ref{fig:gapminder}, which plots this data for all 142 countries in the data.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/gapminder-1} 

}

\caption{Life Expectancy over GDP per Capita in 2007}\label{fig:gapminder}
\end{figure}

Let's view this plot through the grammar of graphics:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The \texttt{data} variable \textbf{GDP per Capita} gets mapped to the \texttt{x}-position \texttt{aes}thetic of the points.
\item
  The \texttt{data} variable \textbf{Life Expectancy} gets mapped to the \texttt{y}-position \texttt{aes}thetic of the points.
\item
  The \texttt{data} variable \textbf{Population} gets mapped to the \texttt{size} \texttt{aes}thetic of the points.
\item
  The \texttt{data} variable \textbf{Continent} gets mapped to the \texttt{color} \texttt{aes}thetic of the points.
\end{enumerate}

We'll see shortly that \texttt{data} corresponds to the particular data frame where our data is saved and a ``data variable'' corresponds to a particular column in the data frame. Furthermore, the type of \texttt{geom}etric object considered in this plot are points. That being said, while in this example we are considering points, graphics are not limited to just points. Other plots involve lines while others involve bars.

Let's summarize the three essential components of the Grammar in Table \ref{tab:summary-table-gapminder}.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:summary-table-gapminder}Summary of Grammar of Graphics for this plot}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\hypertarget{other-components}{%
\subsection{Other components}\label{other-components}}

There are other components of the Grammar of Graphics we can control as well. As you start to delve deeper into the Grammar of Graphics, you'll start to encounter these topics more frequently. In this book however, we'll keep things simple and only work with the two additional components listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{facet}ing breaks up a plot into small multiples corresponding to the levels of another variable (Section \ref{facets})
\item
  \texttt{position} adjustments for barplots (Section \ref{geombar})
\end{itemize}

Other more complex components like \texttt{scales} and \texttt{coord}inate systems are left for a more advanced text such as \href{http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html\#aesthetic-mappings}{R for Data Science} \citep{rds2016}. Generally speaking, the Grammar of Graphics allows for a high degree of customization of plots and also a consistent framework for easily updating and modifying them.

\hypertarget{ggplot2-package}{%
\subsection{ggplot2 package}\label{ggplot2-package}}

In this book, we will be using the \texttt{ggplot2} package for data visualization, which is an implementation of the Grammar of Graphics for R \citep{R-ggplot2}. As we noted earlier, a lot of the previous section was written in a computer code type font. This is because the various components of the Grammar of Graphics are specified in the \texttt{ggplot()} function included in the \texttt{ggplot2} package, which expects at a minimum as arguments (i.e.~inputs):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The data frame where the variables exist: the \texttt{data} argument.
\item
  The mapping of the variables to aesthetic attributes: the \texttt{mapping} argument which specifies the \texttt{aes}thetic attributes involved.
\end{itemize}

After we've specified these components, we then add \emph{layers} to the plot using the \texttt{+} sign. The most essential layer to add to a plot is the layer that specifies which type of \texttt{geom}etric object we want the plot to involve: points, lines, bars, and others. Other layers we can add to a plot include layers specifying the plot title, axes labels, visual themes for the plots, and facets (which we'll see in Section \ref{facets}).

Let's now put the theory of the Grammar of Graphics into practice.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{FiveNG}{%
\section{Five Named Graphs - The 5NG}\label{FiveNG}}

In order to keep things simple, we will only five different types of graphics in this book, each with a commonly given name. We term these ``five named graphs'' the \textbf{5NG}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  scatterplots
\item
  linegraphs
\item
  boxplots
\item
  histograms
\item
  barplots
\end{enumerate}

We will discuss some variations of these plots, but with this basic repertoire of graphics in your toolbox you can visualize a wide array of different variable types. Note that certain plots are only appropriate for categorical variables and while others are only appropriate for quantitative variables. You'll want to quiz yourself often as we go along on which plot makes sense a given a particular problem or data set.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{scatterplots}{%
\section{5NG\#1: Scatterplots}\label{scatterplots}}

The simplest of the 5NG are \emph{scatterplots}, also called bivariate plots. They allow you to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables. While you may already be familiar with scatterplots, let's view them through the lens of the Grammar of Graphics. Specifically, we will visualize the relationship between the following two numerical variables in the \texttt{flights} data frame included in the \texttt{nycflights13} package:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{dep\_delay}: departure delay on the horizontal ``x'' axis and
\item
  \texttt{arr\_delay}: arrival delay on the vertical ``y'' axis
\end{enumerate}

for Alaska Airlines flights leaving NYC in 2013. This requires paring down the data from all 336,776 flights that left NYC in 2013, to only the 714 \emph{Alaska Airlines} flights that left NYC in 2013.

What this means computationally is: we'll take the \texttt{flights} data frame, extract only the 714 rows corresponding to Alaska Airlines flights, and save this in a new data frame called \texttt{alaska\_flights}. Run the code below to do this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{alaska_flights <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(carrier }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "AS"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

For now we suggest you ignore how this code works; we'll explain this in detail in Chapter \ref{wrangling} when we cover data wrangling. However, convince yourself that this code does what it is supposed to by running \texttt{View(alaska\_flights)}: it creates a new data frame \texttt{alaska\_flights} consisting of only the 714 Alaska Airlines flights.

We'll see later in Chapter \ref{wrangling} on data wrangling that this code uses the \texttt{dplyr} package for data wrangling to achieve our goal: it takes the \texttt{flights} data frame and \texttt{filter}s it to only return the rows where \texttt{carrier} is equal to \texttt{"AS"}, Alaska Airlines' carrier code. Other examples of carrier codes include ``AA'' for American Airlines and ``UA'' for United Airlines. Recall from Section \ref{code} that testing for equality is specified with \texttt{==} and not \texttt{=}. Fasten your seat belts and sit tight for now however, we'll introduce these ideas more fully in Chapter \ref{wrangling}.

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC3.1)} Take a look at both the \texttt{flights} and \texttt{alaska\_flights} data frames by running \texttt{View(flights)} and \texttt{View(alaska\_flights)}. In what respect do these data frames differ?

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

\hypertarget{geompoint}{%
\subsection{Scatterplots via geom\_point}\label{geompoint}}

Let's now go over the code that will create the desired scatterplot, keeping in mind our discussion on the Grammar of Graphics in Section \ref{grammarofgraphics}. We'll be using the \texttt{ggplot()} function included in the \texttt{ggplot2} package.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ alaska_flights, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ dep_delay, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ arr_delay)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's break this down piece-by-piece:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Within the \texttt{ggplot()} function, we specify two of the components of the Grammar of Graphics as arguments (i.e.~inputs):

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The \texttt{data} frame to be \texttt{alaska\_flights} by setting \texttt{data\ =\ alaska\_flights}.
  \item
    The \texttt{aes}thetic \texttt{mapping} by setting \texttt{aes(x\ =\ dep\_delay,\ y\ =\ arr\_delay)}. Specifically:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      the variable \texttt{dep\_delay} maps to the \texttt{x} position aesthetic
    \item
      the variable \texttt{arr\_delay} maps to the \texttt{y} position aesthetic
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  We add a layer to the \texttt{ggplot()} function call using the \texttt{+} sign. The layer in question specifies the third component of the grammar: the \texttt{geom}etric object. In this case the geometric object are points, set by specifying \texttt{geom\_point()}.
\end{itemize}

After running the above code, you'll notice two outputs: a warning message and the graphic shown in Figure \ref{fig:noalpha}. Let's first unpack the warning message:

\begin{verbatim}
Warning: Removed 5 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/noalpha-1} 

}

\caption{Arrival Delays vs Departure Delays for Alaska Airlines flights from NYC in 2013}\label{fig:noalpha}
\end{figure}

After running the above code, R returns a warning message alerting us to the fact that 5 rows were ignored due to them being missing. For 5 rows either the value for \texttt{dep\_delay} or \texttt{arr\_delay} or both were missing (recorded in R as \texttt{NA}), and thus these rows were ignored in our plot. Turning our attention to the resulting scatterplot in Figure \ref{fig:noalpha}, we see that a positive relationship exists between \texttt{dep\_delay} and \texttt{arr\_delay}: as departure delays increase, arrival delays tend to also increase. We also note the large mass of points clustered near (0, 0).

Before we continue, let's consider a few more notes on the layers in the above code that generated the scatterplot:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Note that the \texttt{+} sign comes at the end of lines, and not at the beginning. You'll get an error in R if you put it at the beginning.
\item
  When adding layers to a plot, you are encouraged to start a new line after the \texttt{+} so that the code for each layer is on a new line. As we add more and more layers to plots, you'll see this will greatly improve the legibility of your code.
\item
  To stress the importance of adding layers in particular the layer specifying the \texttt{geom}etric object, consider Figure \ref{fig:nolayers} where no layers are added. A not very useful plot!
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{overplotting}{%
\subsection{Over-plotting}\label{overplotting}}

The large mass of points near (0, 0) in Figure \ref{fig:noalpha} can cause some confusion as it is hard to tell the true number of points that are plotted. This is the result of a phenomenon called \emph{overplotting}. As one may guess, this corresponds to values being plotted on top of each other \emph{over} and \emph{over} again. It is often difficult to know just how many values are plotted in this way when looking at a basic scatterplot as we have here. There are two methods to address the issue of overplotting:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  By adjusting the transparency of the points.
\item
  By adding a little random ``jitter'', or random ``nudges'', to each of the points.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Method 1: Changing the transparency}

The first way of addressing overplotting is by changing the transparency of the points by using the \texttt{alpha} argument in \texttt{geom\_point()}. By default, this value is set to \texttt{1}. We can change this to any value between \texttt{0} and \texttt{1}, where \texttt{0} sets the points to be 100\% transparent and \texttt{1} sets the points to be 100\% opaque. Note how the following code is identical to the code in Section \ref{scatterplots} that created the scatterplot with overplotting, but with \texttt{alpha\ =\ 0.2} added to the \texttt{geom\_point()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ alaska_flights, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ dep_delay, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ arr_delay)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{alpha =} \FloatTok{0.2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/alpha-1} 

}

\caption{Delay scatterplot with alpha=0.2}\label{fig:alpha}
\end{figure}

The key feature to note in Figure \ref{fig:alpha} is that the transparency of the points is cumulative: areas with a high-degree of overplotting are darker, whereas areas with a lower degree are less dark. Note furthermore that there is no \texttt{aes()} surrounding \texttt{alpha\ =\ 0.2}. This is because we are not mapping a variable to an aesthetic attribute, but rather merely changing the default setting of \texttt{alpha}. In fact, you'll receive an error if you try to change the second line above to read \texttt{geom\_point(aes(alpha\ =\ 0.2))}.

\textbf{Method 2: Jittering the points}

The second way of addressing overplotting is by \emph{jittering} all the points, in other words give each point a small nudge in a random direction. You can think of ``jittering'' as shaking the points around a bit on the plot. Let's illustrate using a simple example first. Say we have a data frame \texttt{jitter\_example} with 4 rows of identical value 0 for both \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}:

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 4 x 2
      x     y
  <dbl> <dbl>
1     0     0
2     0     0
3     0     0
4     0     0
\end{verbatim}

We display the resulting scatterplot in Figure \ref{fig:jitter-example-plot-1}; observe that the 4 points are superimposed on top of each other. While we know there are 4 values being plotted, this fact might not be apparent to others.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/jitter-example-plot-1-1} 

}

\caption{Regular scatterplot of jitter example data}\label{fig:jitter-example-plot-1}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:jitter-example-plot-2} we instead display a \emph{jittered scatterplot} where each point is given a random ``nudge.'' It is now plainly evident that this plot involves four points. Keep in mind that jittering is strictly a visualization tool; even after creating a jittered scatterplot, the original values saved in \texttt{jitter\_example} remain unchanged.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/jitter-example-plot-2-1} 

}

\caption{Jittered scatterplot of jitter example data}\label{fig:jitter-example-plot-2}
\end{figure}

To create a jittered scatterplot, instead of using \texttt{geom\_point()}, we use \texttt{geom\_jitter()}. To specify how much jitter to add, we adjust the \texttt{width} and \texttt{height} arguments. This corresponds to how hard you'd like to shake the plot in units corresponding to those for both the horizontal and vertical variables (in this case minutes).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ alaska_flights, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ dep_delay, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ arr_delay)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_jitter}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{width =} \DecValTok{30}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{height =} \DecValTok{30}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/jitter-1} 

}

\caption{Jittered delay scatterplot}\label{fig:jitter}
\end{figure}

Observe how the above code is identical to the code that created the scatterplot with overplotting in Subsection \ref{geompoint}, but with \texttt{geom\_point()} replaced with \texttt{geom\_jitter()}.

The resulting plot in Figure \ref{fig:jitter} helps us a little bit in getting a sense for the overplotting, but with a relatively large data set like this one (714 flights), it can be argued that changing the transparency of the points by setting \texttt{alpha} proved more effective. In terms of how much jitter one should add using the \texttt{width} and \texttt{height} arguments, it is important to add just enough jitter to break any overlap in points, but not so much that we completely alter the overall pattern in points.

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC3.7)} Why is setting the \texttt{alpha} argument value useful with scatterplots? What further information does it give you that a regular scatterplot cannot?

\textbf{(LC3.8)} After viewing the Figure \ref{fig:alpha} above, give an approximate range of arrival delays and departure delays that occur the most frequently. How has that region changed compared to when you observed the same plot without the \texttt{alpha\ =\ 0.2} set in Figure \ref{fig:noalpha}?

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

Scatterplots display the relationship between two numerical variables. They are among the most commonly used plots because they can provide an immediate way to see the trend in one variable versus another. However, if you try to create a scatterplot where either one of the two variables is not numerical, you might get strange results. Be careful!

With medium to large data sets, you may need to play around with the different modifications one can make to a scatterplot. This tweaking is often a fun part of data visualization, since you'll have the chance to see different relationships come about as you make subtle changes to your plots.

Linegraphs show the relationship between two numerical variables when the variable on the x-axis, also called the \emph{explanatory} variable, is of a sequential nature; in other words there is an inherent ordering to the variable. The most common example of linegraphs have some notion of time on the x-axis: hours, days, weeks, years, etc. Since time is sequential, we connect consecutive observations of the variable on the y-axis with a line. Linegraphs that have some notion of time on the x-axis are also called \emph{time series} plots. Linegraphs should be avoided when there is not a clear sequential ordering to the variable on the x-axis. Let's illustrate linegraphs using another data set in the \texttt{nycflights13} package: the \texttt{weather} data frame.

Let's get a sense for the \texttt{weather} data frame:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Explore the \texttt{weather} data by running \texttt{View(weather)}.
\item
  Run \texttt{?weather} to bring up the help file.
\end{itemize}

We can see that there is a variable called \texttt{temp} of hourly temperature recordings in Fahrenheit at weather stations near all three airports in New York City: Newark (\texttt{origin} code \texttt{EWR}), JFK, and La Guardia (\texttt{LGA}). Instead of considering hourly temperatures for all days in 2013 for all three airports however, for simplicity let's only consider hourly temperatures at only Newark airport for the first 15 days in January.

Recall in Section \ref{scatterplots} we used the \texttt{filter()} function to only choose the subset of rows of \texttt{flights} corresponding to Alaska Airlines flights. We similarly use \texttt{filter()} here, but by using the \texttt{\&} operator we only choose the subset of rows of \texttt{weather} where

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The \texttt{origin} is \texttt{"EWR"} and
\item
  the \texttt{month} is January and
\item
  the \texttt{day} is between \texttt{1} and \texttt{15}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{early_january_weather <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{weather }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC3.9)} Take a look at both the \texttt{weather} and \texttt{early\_january\_weather} data frames by running \texttt{View(weather)} and \texttt{View(early\_january\_weather)}. In what respect do these data frames differ?

\textbf{(LC3.10)} \texttt{View()} the \texttt{flights} data frame again. Why does the \texttt{time\_hour} variable uniquely identify the hour of the measurement whereas the \texttt{hour} variable does not?

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

\hypertarget{geomline}{%
\subsection{Linegraphs via geom\_line}\label{geomline}}

Let's plot a linegraph of hourly temperatures in \texttt{early\_january\_weather} by using \texttt{geom\_line()} instead of \texttt{geom\_point()} like we did for scatterplots:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ early_january_weather, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ time_hour, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ temp)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_line}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/hourlytemp-1} 

}

\caption{Hourly Temperature in Newark for January 1-15, 2013}\label{fig:hourlytemp}
\end{figure}

Much as with the \texttt{ggplot()} code that created the scatterplot of departure and arrival delays for Alaska Airlines flights in Figure \ref{fig:noalpha}, let's break down the above code piece-by-piece in terms of the Grammar of Graphics:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Within the \texttt{ggplot()} function call, we specify two of the components of the Grammar of Graphics as arguments:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The \texttt{data} frame to be \texttt{early\_january\_weather} by setting \texttt{data\ =\ early\_january\_weather}
  \item
    The \texttt{aes}thetic mapping by setting \texttt{aes(x\ =\ time\_hour,\ y\ =\ temp)}. Specifically:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      the variable \texttt{time\_hour} maps to the \texttt{x} position aesthetic.
    \item
      the variable \texttt{temp} maps to the \texttt{y} position aesthetic
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  We add a layer to the \texttt{ggplot()} function call using the \texttt{+} sign. The layer in question specifies the third component of the grammar: the \texttt{geom}etric object in question. In this case the geometric object is a \texttt{line}, set by specifying \texttt{geom\_line()}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC3.11)} Why should linegraphs be avoided when there is not a clear ordering of the horizontal axis?

\textbf{(LC3.12)} Why are linegraphs frequently used when time is the explanatory variable on the x-axis?

\textbf{(LC3.13)} Plot a time series of a variable other than \texttt{temp} for Newark Airport in the first 15 days of January 2013.

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

\hypertarget{summary-1}{%
\subsection{Summary}\label{summary-1}}

Linegraphs, just like scatterplots, display the relationship between two numerical variables. However it is preferred to use linegraphs over scatterplots when the variable on the x-axis (i.e.~the explanatory variable) has an inherent ordering, like some notion of time.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{histograms}{%
\section{5NG\#3: Histograms}\label{histograms}}

Let's consider the \texttt{temp} variable in the \texttt{weather} data frame once again, but unlike with the linegraphs in Section \ref{linegraphs}, let's say we don't care about the relationship of temperature to time, but rather we only care about how the values of \texttt{temp} \emph{distribute}. In other words:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What are the smallest and largest values?
\item
  What is the ``center'' value?
\item
  How do the values spread out?
\item
  What are frequent and infrequent values?
\end{enumerate}

One way to visualize this \emph{distribution} of this single variable \texttt{temp} is to plot them on a horizontal line as we do in Figure \ref{fig:temp-on-line}:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/temp-on-line-1} 

}

\caption{Plot of Hourly Temperature Recordings from NYC in 2013}\label{fig:temp-on-line}
\end{figure}

This gives us a general idea of how the values of \texttt{temp} distribute: observe that temperatures vary from around 11°F up to 100°F. Furthermore, there appear to be more recorded temperatures between 40°F and 60°F than outside this range. However, because of the high degree of overlap in the points, it's hard to get a sense of exactly how many values are between, say, 50°F and 55°F.

What is commonly produced instead of the above plot is known as a \emph{histogram}. A histogram is a plot that visualizes the \emph{distribution} of a numerical value as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We first cut up the x-axis into a series of \emph{bins}, where each bin represents a range of values.
\item
  For each bin, we count the number of observations that fall in the range corresponding to that bin.
\item
  Then for each bin, we draw a bar whose height marks the corresponding count.
\end{enumerate}

Let's drill-down on an example of a histogram, shown in Figure \ref{fig:histogramexample}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/histogramexample-1} 

}

\caption{Example histogram.}\label{fig:histogramexample}
\end{figure}

Observe that there are three bins of equal width between 30°F and 60°F, thus we have three bins of width 10°F each: one bin for the 30-40°F range, another bin for the 40-50°F range, and another bin for the 50-60°F range. Since:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The bin for the 30-40°F range has a height of around 5000, this histogram is telling us that around 5000 of the hourly temperature recordings are between 30°F and 40°F.
\item
  The bin for the 40-50°F range has a height of around 4300, this histogram is telling us that around 4300 of the hourly temperature recordings are between 40°F and 50°F.
\item
  The bin for the 50-60°F range has a height of around 3500, this histogram is telling us that around 3500 of the hourly temperature recordings are between 50°F and 60°F.
\end{enumerate}

The remaining bins all have a similar interpretation.

\hypertarget{geomhistogram}{%
\subsection{Histograms via geom\_histogram}\label{geomhistogram}}

Let's now present the \texttt{ggplot()} code to plot your first histogram! Unlike with scatterplots and linegraphs, there is now only one variable being mapped in \texttt{aes()}: the single numerical variable \texttt{temp}. The y-aesthetic of a histogram gets computed for you automatically. Furthermore, the geometric object layer is now a \texttt{geom\_histogram()}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ weather, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ temp)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_histogram}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with
`binwidth`.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/weather-histogram-1} 

}

\caption{Histogram of hourly temperatures at three NYC airports.}\label{fig:weather-histogram}
\end{figure}

Let's unpack the messages R sent us first. The first message is telling us that the histogram was constructed using \texttt{bins\ =\ 30}, in other words 30 equally spaced bins. This is known in computer programming as a default value; unless you override this default number of bins with a number you specify, R will choose 30 by default. We'll see in the next section how to change this default number of bins. The second message is telling us something similar to the warning message we received when we ran the code to create a scatterplot of departure and arrival delays for Alaska Airlines flights in Figure \ref{fig:noalpha}: that because one row has a missing \texttt{NA} value for \texttt{temp}, it was omitted from the histogram. R is just giving us a friendly heads up that this was the case.

Now's let's unpack the resulting histogram in Figure \ref{fig:weather-histogram}. Observe that values less than 25°F as well as values above 80°F are rather rare. However, because of the large number of bins, its hard to get a sense for which range of temperatures is covered by each bin; everything is one giant amorphous blob. So let's add white vertical borders demarcating the bins by adding a \texttt{color\ =\ "white"} argument to \texttt{geom\_histogram()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ weather, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ temp)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_histogram}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{color =} \StringTok{"white"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/weather-histogram-2-1} 

}

\caption{Histogram of hourly temperatures at three NYC airports with white borders.}\label{fig:weather-histogram-2}
\end{figure}

We can now better associate ranges of temperatures to each of the bins. We can also vary the color of the bars by setting the \texttt{fill} argument. Run \texttt{colors()} to see all 657 possible choice of colors!

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ weather, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ temp)) }\OperatorTok{+}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/weather-histogram-3-1} 

}

\caption{Histogram of hourly temperatures at three NYC airports with white borders.}\label{fig:weather-histogram-3}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{adjustbins}{%
\subsection{Adjusting the bins}\label{adjustbins}}

Observe in both Figure \ref{fig:weather-histogram-2} and Figure \ref{fig:weather-histogram-3} that in the 50-75°F range there appear to be roughly 8 bins. Thus each bin has width 25 divided by 8, or roughly 3.12°F which is not a very easily interpretable range to work with. Let's now adjust the number of bins in our histogram in one of two methods:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  By adjusting the number of bins via the \texttt{bins} argument to \texttt{geom\_histogram()}.
\item
  By adjusting the width of the bins via the \texttt{binwidth} argument to \texttt{geom\_histogram()}.
\end{enumerate}

Using the first method, we have the power to specify how many bins we would like to cut the x-axis up in. As mentioned in the previous section, the default number of bins is 30. We can override this default, to say 40 bins, as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ weather, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ temp)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_histogram}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{bins =} \DecValTok{40}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{color =} \StringTok{"white"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-28-1} 

}

\caption{Histogram with 40 bins.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-28}
\end{figure}

Using the second method, instead of specifying the number of bins, we specify the width of the bins by using the \texttt{binwidth} argument in the \texttt{geom\_histogram()} layer. For example, let's set the width of each bin to be 10°F.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ weather, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ temp)) }\OperatorTok{+}

\hypertarget{summary-2}{%

Histograms, unlike scatterplots and linegraphs, present information on only a single numerical variable. Specifically, they are visualizations of the distribution of the numerical variable in question.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{facets}{%
\section{Facets}\label{facets}}

Before continuing the 5NG, let's briefly introduce a new concept called \emph{faceting}. Faceting is used when we'd like to split a particular visualization of variables by another variable. This will create multiple copies of the same type of plot with matching x and y axes, but whose content will differ.

For example, suppose we were interested in looking at how the histogram of hourly temperature recordings at the three NYC airports we saw in Section \ref{histograms} differed by month. We would ``split'' this histogram by the 12 possible months in a given year, in other words plot histograms of \texttt{temp} for each \texttt{month}. We do this by adding \texttt{facet\_wrap(\textasciitilde{}\ month)} layer.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ weather, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ temp)) }\OperatorTok{+}

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{facet_wrap}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{month)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/facethistogram-1} 

}

\caption{Faceted histogram.}\label{fig:facethistogram}
\end{figure}

Note the use of the tilde \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} before \texttt{month} in \texttt{facet\_wrap()}. The tilde is required and you'll receive the error \texttt{Error\ in\ as.quoted(facets)\ :\ object\ \textquotesingle{}month\textquotesingle{}\ not\ found} if you don't include it before \texttt{month} here. We can also specify the number of rows and columns in the grid by using the \texttt{nrow} and \texttt{ncol} arguments inside of \texttt{facet\_wrap()}. For example, say we would like our faceted plot to have 4 rows instead of 3. Add the \texttt{nrow\ =\ 4} argument to \texttt{facet\_wrap(\textasciitilde{}\ month)}

\begin{Shaded}

Observe in both Figure \ref{fig:facethistogram} and Figure \ref{fig:facethistogram2} that as we might expect in the Northern Hemisphere, temperatures tend to be higher in the summer months, while they tend to be lower in the winter.

\textbf{(LC3.20)} For which types of data sets would these types of faceted plots not work well in comparing relationships between variables? Give an example describing the nature of these variables and other important characteristics.

\hypertarget{boxplots}{%
\section{5NG\#4: Boxplots}\label{boxplots}}

While faceted histograms are one visualization that allows us to compare distributions of a numerical variable split by another variable, another visualization that achieves this same goal are \emph{side-by-side boxplots}. A boxplot is constructed from the information provided in the \emph{five-number summary} of a numerical variable (see Appendix \ref{appendixA}). To keep things simple for now, let's only consider hourly temperature recordings for the month of November in Figure \ref{fig:nov1}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/nov1-1} 

}

\caption{November temperatures.}\label{fig:nov1}
\end{figure}

These 2141 observations have the following five-number summary:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Minimum: 21.02°F
\item
  First quartile AKA 25\textsuperscript{th} percentile: 35.96°F
\item
  Median AKA second quartile AKA 50\textsuperscript{th} percentile: 44.96°F
\item
  Third quartile AKA 75\textsuperscript{th} percentile: 51.98°F
\item
  Maximum: 71.06°F
\end{enumerate}

Let's mark these 5 values with dashed horizontal lines in Figure \ref{fig:nov2}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/nov2-1} 

}

\caption{November temperatures.}\label{fig:nov2}
\end{figure}

Let's add the boxplot underneath these points and dashed horizontal lines in Figure \ref{fig:nov3}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/nov3-1} 

}

\caption{November temperatures.}\label{fig:nov3}
\end{figure}

What the boxplot does summarize the 2141 points by emphasizing that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  25\% of points (about 534 observations) fall below the bottom edge of the box, which is the first quartile of 35.96°F. In other words 25\% of observations were colder than 35.96°F.
\item
  25\% of points fall between the bottom edge of the box and the solid middle line, which is the median of 44.96°F. In other words 25\% of observations were between 35.96 and 44.96°F and 50\% of observations were colder than 44.96°F.
\item
  25\% of points fall between the solid middle line and the top edge of the box, which is the third quartile of 51.98°F. In other words 25\% of observations were between 44.96 and 51.98°F and 75\% of observations were colder than 51.98°F.
\item
  25\% of points fall over the top edge of the box. In other words 25\% of observations were warmer than 51.98°F.
\item
  The middle 50\% of points lie within the \emph{interquartile range} between the first and third quartile of 51.98 - 35.96 = 16.02°F.
\end{enumerate}

Lastly, for clarity's sake let's remove the points but keep the dashed horizontal lines in Figure \ref{fig:nov4}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/nov4-1} 

}

\caption{November temperatures.}\label{fig:nov4}
\end{figure}

We can now better see the \emph{whiskers} of the boxplot. They stick out from either end of the box all the way to the minimum and maximum observed temperatures of 21.02°F and 71.06°F respectively. However, the whiskers don't always extend to the smallest and largest observed values. They in fact can extend no more than 1.5 \(\times\) the interquartile range from either end of the box, in this case 1.5 \(\times\) 16.02°F = 24.03°F from either end of the box. Any observed values outside this whiskers get marked with points called \emph{outliers}, which we'll see in the next section.

\hypertarget{geomboxplot}{%
\subsection{Boxplots via geom\_boxplot}\label{geomboxplot}}

Let's now create a side-by-side boxplot of hourly temperatures split by the 12 months as we did above with the faceted histograms. We do this by mapping the \texttt{month} variable to the x-position aesthetic, the \texttt{temp} variable to the y-position aesthetic, and by adding a \texttt{geom\_boxplot()} layer:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ weather, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ month, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ temp)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_boxplot}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/badbox-1} 

}

\caption{Invalid boxplot specification}\label{fig:badbox}
\end{figure}

\begin{verbatim}
Warning messages:
1: Continuous x aesthetic -- did you forget aes(group=...)? 
2: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot). 
\end{verbatim}

Observe in Figure \ref{fig:badbox} that this plot does not provide information about temperature separated by month. The warning messages clue us in as to why. The second warning message is identical to the warning message when plotting a histogram of hourly temperatures: that one of the values was recorded as \texttt{NA} missing. However, the first warning message is telling us that we have a ``continuous'', or numerical variable, on the x-position aesthetic. Boxplots however require a categorical variable on the x-axis.

We can convert the numerical variable \texttt{month} into a categorical variable by using the \texttt{factor()} function. So after applying \texttt{factor(month)}, month goes from having numerical values 1, 2, \ldots{}, 12 to having labels ``1'', ``2'', \ldots{}, ``12.''

The resulting Figure \ref{fig:monthtempbox} shows 12 separate ``box and whiskers'' plots with the features we saw earlier focusing only on November:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The ``box'' portions of this visualization represent the 1\textsuperscript{st} quartile, the median AKA the 2\textsuperscript{nd} quartile, and the 3\textsuperscript{rd} quartile.

  The height of each box, i.e.~the value of the 3\textsuperscript{rd} quartile minus the value of the 1\textsuperscript{st} quartile, is the \emph{interquartile range}. It is a measure of spread of the middle 50\% of values, with longer boxes indicating more variability.
\item
  The ``whisker'' portions of these plots extend out from the bottoms and tops of the boxes and represent points less than the 25\textsuperscript{th} percentile and greater than the 75\textsuperscript{th} percentiles respectively. They're set to extend out no more than \(1.5 \times IQR\) units away from either end of the boxes. We say ``no more than'' because the ends of the whiskers have to correspond to observed temperatures. The length of these whiskers show how the data outside the middle 50\% of values vary, with longer whiskers indicating more variability.
\item
  The dots representing values falling outside the whiskers are called \emph{outliers}. These can be thought of as anomalous values.
\end{itemize}

It is important to keep in mind that the definition of an outlier is somewhat arbitrary and not absolute. In this case, they are defined by the length of the whiskers, which are no more than \(1.5 \times IQR\) units long. Looking at this plot we can see, as expected, that summer months (6 through 8) have higher median temperatures as evidenced by the higher solid lines in the middle of the boxes. We can easily compare temperatures across months by drawing imaginary horizontal lines across the plot. Furthermore, the height of the 12 boxes as quantified by the interquartile ranges are informative too; they tell us about variability, or spread, of temperatures recorded in a given month.

\hypertarget{summary-3}{%
\subsection{Summary}\label{summary-3}}

Side-by-side boxplots provide us with a way to compare and contrast the distribution of a quantitative variable across multiple levels of another categorical variable. One can see where the median falls across the different groups by looking at the center line in the boxes. To see how spread out the variable is across the different groups, look at both the width of the box and also how far the whiskers stretch out away from the box. Outliers are even more easily identified when looking at a boxplot than when looking at a histogram as they are marked with points.

\hypertarget{geombar}{%
\section{5NG\#5: Barplots}\label{geombar}}

Both histograms and boxplots are tools to visualize the distribution of numerical variables. Another common task is visualize the distribution of a categorical variable. This is a simpler task, as we are simply counting different categories, also known as \emph{levels}, of a categorical variable. Often the best way to visualize these different counts, also known as \emph{frequencies}, is with a barplot (also known as a barchart). One complication, however, is how your data is represented: is the categorical variable of interest ``pre-counted'' or not? For example, run the following code that manually creates two data frames representing a collection of fruit: 3 apples and 2 oranges.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fruits <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{data_frame}\NormalTok{(}
  \DataTypeTok{fruit =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"apple"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"apple"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"orange"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"apple"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"orange"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{fruits_counted <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{data_frame}\NormalTok{(}
  \DataTypeTok{fruit =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"apple"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"orange"}\NormalTok{),}
  \DataTypeTok{number =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We see both the \texttt{fruits} and \texttt{fruits\_counted} data frames represent the same collection of fruit. Whereas \texttt{fruits} just lists the fruit individually\ldots{}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 5 x 1
  fruit 
  <chr> 
1 apple 
2 apple 
3 orange
4 apple 
5 orange
\end{verbatim}

\ldots{} \texttt{fruits\_counted} has a variable \texttt{count} which represents pre-counted values of each fruit.

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 2 x 2
  fruit  number
  <chr>   <dbl>
1 apple       3
2 orange      2
\end{verbatim}

Depending on how your categorical data is represented, you'll need to use add a different \texttt{geom} layer to your \texttt{ggplot()} to create a barplot, as we now explore.

\hypertarget{barplots-via-geom_bar-or-geom_col}{%
\subsection{Barplots via geom\_bar or geom\_col}\label{barplots-via-geom_bar-or-geom_col}}

Let's generate barplots using these two different representations of the same basket of fruit: 3 apples and 2 oranges. Using the \texttt{fruits} data frame where all 5 fruits are listed individually in 5 rows, we map the \texttt{fruit} variable to the x-position aesthetic and add a \texttt{geom\_bar()} layer.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ fruits, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ fruit)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_bar}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/geombar-1} 

}

\caption{Barplot when counts are not pre-counted}\label{fig:geombar}
\end{figure}

However, using the \texttt{fruits\_counted} data frame where the fruit have been ``pre-counted'', we map the \texttt{fruit} variable to the x-position aesthetic as with \texttt{geom\_bar()}, but we also map the \texttt{count} variable to the y-position aesthetic, and add a \texttt{geom\_col()} layer.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ fruits_counted, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ fruit, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ number)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_col}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/geomcol-1} 

}

\caption{Barplot when counts are pre-counted}\label{fig:geomcol}
\end{figure}

Compare the barplots in Figures \ref{fig:geombar} and \ref{fig:geomcol}. They are identical because they reflect count of the same 5 fruit. However depending on how our data is saved, either pre-counted or not, we must add a different \texttt{geom} layer. When the categorical variable whose distribution you want to visualize is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Is not pre-counted in your data frame: use \texttt{geom\_bar()}.
\item
  Is pre-counted in your data frame, use \texttt{geom\_col()} with the y-position aesthetic mapped to the variable that has the counts.
\end{itemize}

Let's now go back to the \texttt{flights} data frame in the \texttt{nycflights13} package and visualize the distribution of the categorical variable \texttt{carrier}. In other words, let's visualize the number of domestic flights out of the three New York City airports each airline company flew in 2013. Recall from Section \ref{exploredataframes} when you first explored the \texttt{flights} data frame you saw that each row corresponds to a flight. In other words the \texttt{flights} data frame is more like the \texttt{fruits} data frame than the \texttt{fruits\_counted} data frame above, and thus we should use \texttt{geom\_bar()} instead of \texttt{geom\_col()} to create a barplot. Much like a \texttt{geom\_histogram()}, there is only one variable in the \texttt{aes()} aesthetic mapping: the variable \texttt{carrier} gets mapped to the \texttt{x}-position.



\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ flights, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ carrier)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_bar}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/flightsbar-1} 

}

\caption{Number of flights departing NYC in 2013 by airline using geom\_bar}\label{fig:flightsbar}
\end{figure}

Observe in Figure \ref{fig:flightsbar} that United Air Lines (UA), JetBlue Airways (B6), and ExpressJet Airlines (EV) had the most flights depart New York City in 2013. If you don't know which airlines correspond to which carrier codes, then run \texttt{View(airlines)} to see a directory of airlines. For example: AA is American Airlines; B6 is JetBlue Airways; DL is Delta Airlines; EV is ExpressJet Airlines; MQ is Envoy Air; while UA is United Airlines.

Alternatively, say you had a data frame \texttt{flights\_counted} where the number of flights for each \texttt{carrier} was pre-counted like in Table \ref{tab:flights-counted}.

In order to create a barplot visualizing the distribution of the categorical variable \texttt{carrier} in this case, we would use \texttt{geom\_col()} instead with \texttt{x} mapped to \texttt{carrier} and \texttt{y} mapped to \texttt{number} as seen below. The resulting barplot would be identical to Figure \ref{fig:flightsbar}.

\hypertarget{must-avoid-pie-charts}{%
\subsection{Must avoid pie charts!}\label{must-avoid-pie-charts}}

Unfortunately, one of the most common plots seen today for categorical data is the pie chart. While they may seem harmless enough, they actually present a problem in that humans are unable to judge angles well. As Naomi Robbins describes in her book ``Creating More Effective Graphs'' \citep{robbins2013}, we overestimate angles greater than 90 degrees and we underestimate angles less than 90 degrees. In other words, it is difficult for us to determine relative size of one piece of the pie compared to another.

Let's examine the same data used in our previous barplot of the number of flights departing NYC by airline in Figure \ref{fig:flightsbar}, but this time we will use a pie chart in Figure \ref{fig:carrierpie}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/carrierpie-1} 

}

\caption{The dreaded pie chart}\label{fig:carrierpie}
\end{figure}

Try to answer the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How much larger the portion of the pie is for ExpressJet Airlines (\texttt{EV}) compared to US Airways (\texttt{US}),
\item
  What the third largest carrier is in terms of departing flights, and
\item
  How many carriers have fewer flights than United Airlines (\texttt{UA})?
\end{itemize}

While it is quite difficult to answer these questions when looking at the pie chart in Figure \ref{fig:carrierpie}, we can much more easily answer these questions using the barchart in Figure \ref{fig:flightsbar}. This is true since barplots present the information in a way such that comparisons between categories can be made with single horizontal lines, whereas pie charts present the information in a way such that comparisons between categories must be made by comparing angles.

There may be one exception of a pie chart not to avoid courtesy Nathan Yau at \href{https://flowingdata.com/2008/09/19/pie-i-have-eaten-and-pie-i-have-not-eaten/}{FlowingData.com}, but we will leave this for the reader to decide:

\hypertarget{two-categ-barplot}{%
\subsection{Two categorical variables}\label{two-categ-barplot}}

Barplots are the go-to way to visualize the frequency of different categories, or levels, of a single categorical variable. Another use of barplots is to visualize the \emph{joint} distribution of two categorical variables at the same time. Let's examine the \emph{joint} distribution of outgoing domestic flights from NYC by \texttt{carrier} and \texttt{origin}, or in other words the number of flights for each \texttt{carrier} and \texttt{origin} combination. For example, the number of WestJet flights from \texttt{JFK}, the number of WestJet flights from \texttt{LGA}, the number of WestJet flights from \texttt{EWR}, the number of American Airlines flights from \texttt{JFK}, and so on. Recall the \texttt{ggplot()} code that created the barplot of \texttt{carrier} frequency in Figure \ref{fig:flightsbar}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ flights, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ carrier)) }\OperatorTok{+}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-38-1} \end{center}

We can now map the additional variable \texttt{origin} by adding a \texttt{fill\ =\ origin} inside the \texttt{aes()} aesthetic mapping; the \texttt{fill} aesthetic of any bar corresponds to the color used to fill the bars.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ flights, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ carrier, }\DataTypeTok{fill =}\NormalTok{ origin)) }\OperatorTok{+}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/flights-stacked-bar-1} 

}

\caption{Stacked barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and origin.}\label{fig:flights-stacked-bar}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:flights-stacked-bar} is an example of a \emph{stacked barplot}. While simple to make, in certain aspects it is not ideal. For example, it is difficult to compare the heights of the different colors between the bars, corresponding to comparing the number of flights from each \texttt{origin} airport between the carriers.

Before we continue, let's address some common points of confusion amongst new R users. First, note that \texttt{fill} is another aesthetic mapping much like \texttt{x}-position; thus it must be included within the parentheses of the \texttt{aes()} mapping. The following code, where the \texttt{fill} aesthetic is specified outside the \texttt{aes()} mapping will yield an error. This is a fairly common error that new \texttt{ggplot} users make:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ flights, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ carrier), }\DataTypeTok{fill =}\NormalTok{ origin) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_bar}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Second, the \texttt{fill} aesthetic corresponds to the color used to fill the bars, while the \texttt{color} aesthetic corresponds to the color of the outline of the bars. Observe in Figure \ref{fig:flights-stacked-bar-color} that mapping \texttt{origin} to \texttt{color} and not \texttt{fill} yields grey bars with different colored outlines.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ flights, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ carrier, }\DataTypeTok{color =}\NormalTok{ origin)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_bar}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{(LC3.33)} What can you say, if anything, about the relationship between airline and airport in NYC in 2013 in regards to the number of departing flights?

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

Another alternative to stacked barplots are \emph{side-by-side barplots}, also known as a \emph{dodged barplot}. The code to created a side-by-side barplot is identical to the code to create a stacked barplot, but with a \texttt{position\ =\ "dodge"} argument added to \texttt{geom\_bar()}. In other words, we are overriding the default barplot type, which is a stacked barplot, and specifying it to be a side-by-side barplot.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ flights, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ carrier, }\DataTypeTok{fill =}\NormalTok{ origin)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_bar}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{position =} \StringTok{"dodge"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}

\textbf{(LC3.35)} What are the disadvantages of using a side-by-side (AKA dodged) barplot, in general?

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

Lastly, another type of barplot is a \emph{faceted barplot}. Recall in Section \ref{facets} we visualized the distribution of hourly temperatures at the 3 NYC airports \emph{split} by month using facets. We apply the same principle to our barplot visualizing the frequency of \texttt{carrier} split by \texttt{origin}: instead of mapping \texttt{origin}

\begin{Shaded}

Barplots are the preferred way of displaying the distribution of a categorical variable, or in other words the frequency with which the different categories called \emph{levels} occur. They are easy to understand and make it easy to make comparisons across levels. When trying to visualize two categorical variables, you have many options: stacked barplots, side-by-side barplots, and faceted barplots. Depending on what aspect of the joint distribution you are trying to emphasize, you will need to make a choice between these three types of barplots.

Let's recap all five of the Five Named Graphs (5NG) in Table \ref{tab:viz-summary-table} summarizing their differences. Using these 5NG, you'll be able to visualize the distributions and relationships of variables contained in a wide array of datasets. This will be even more the case as we start to map more variables to more of each \texttt{geom}etric object's \texttt{aes}thetic attribute options, further unlocking the awesome power of the \texttt{ggplot2} package.

Run the following two segments of code. First this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ flights, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ carrier)) }\OperatorTok{+}

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_bar}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You'll notice that that both code segments create the same barplot, even though in the second segment we omitted the \texttt{data\ =} and \texttt{mapping\ =} code argument names. This is because the \texttt{ggplot()} by default assumes that the \texttt{data} argument comes first and the \texttt{mapping} argument comes second. So as long as you specify the data frame in question first and the \texttt{aes()} mapping second, you can omit the explicit statement of the argument names \texttt{data\ =} and \texttt{mapping\ =}.

Going forward for the rest of this book, all \texttt{ggplot()} will be like the second segment above: with the \texttt{data\ =} and \texttt{mapping\ =} explicit naming of the argument omitted and the default ordering of arguments respected.

These two code segments were a preview of Chapter \ref{wrangling} on data wrangling where we'll delve further into the \texttt{dplyr} package. Data wrangling is the process of transforming and modifying existing data with the intent of making it more appropriate for analysis purposes. For example, the two code segments used the \texttt{filter()} function to create new data frames (\texttt{alaska\_flights} and \texttt{early\_january\_weather}) by choosing only a subset of rows of existing data frames (\texttt{flights} and \texttt{weather}). In this next chapter, we'll formally introduce the \texttt{filter()} and other data wrangling functions as well as the \emph{pipe operator} \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%} which allows you to combine multiple data wrangling actions into a single sequential \emph{chain} of actions. On to Chapter \ref{wrangling} on data wrangling!

\hypertarget{wrangling}{%
\chapter{Data Wrangling}\label{wrangling}}

So far in our journey, we've seen how to look at data saved in data frames using the \texttt{glimpse()} and \texttt{View()} functions in Chapter \ref{getting-started} on and how to create data visualizations using the \texttt{ggplot2} package in Chapter \ref{viz}. In particular we studied what we term the ``five named graphs'' (5NG):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  scatterplots via \texttt{geom\_point()}
\item
  linegraphs via \texttt{geom\_line()}
\item
  boxplots via \texttt{geom\_boxplot()}
\item
  histograms via \texttt{geom\_histogram()}
\item
  barplots via \texttt{geom\_bar()} or \texttt{geom\_col()}
\end{enumerate}

We created these visualizations using the ``Grammar of Graphics'', which maps variables in a data frame to the aesthetic attributes of one the above 5 \texttt{geom}etric objects. We can also control other aesthetic attributes of the geometric objects such as the size and color as seen in the Gapminder data example in Figure \ref{fig:gapminder}.

Recall however in Section \ref{whats-to-come-3} we discussed that for two of our visualizations we needed transformed/modified versions of existing data frames. Recall for example the scatterplot of departure and arrival delay \emph{only} for Alaska Airlines flights. In order to create this visualization, we needed to first pare down the \texttt{flights} data frame to a new data frame \texttt{alaska\_flights} consisting of only \texttt{carrier\ ==\ "AS"} flights using the \texttt{filter()} function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{alaska_flights <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(carrier }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "AS"}\NormalTok{)}

\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ alaska_flights, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ dep_delay, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ arr_delay)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In this chapter, we'll introduce a series of functions from the \texttt{dplyr} package that will allow you to take a data frame and

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{filter()} its existing rows to only pick out a subset of them. For example, the \texttt{alaska\_flights} data frame above.
\item
  \texttt{summarize()} one of its columns/variables with a \emph{summary statistic}. Examples include the median and interquartile range of temperatures as we saw in Section \ref{boxplots} on boxplots.
\item
  \texttt{group\_by()} its rows. In other words assign different rows to be part of the same \emph{group} and report summary statistics for each group separately. For example, say perhaps you don't want a single overall average departure delay \texttt{dep\_delay} for all three \texttt{origin} airports combined, but rather three separate average departure delays, one for each of the three \texttt{origin} airports.
\item
  \texttt{mutate()} its existing columns/variables to create new ones. For example, convert hourly temperature recordings from °F to °C.
\item
  \texttt{arrange()} its rows. For example, sort the rows of \texttt{weather} in ascending or descending order of \texttt{temp}.
\item
  \texttt{join()} it with another data frame by matching along a ``key'' variable. In other words, merge these two data frames together.
\end{enumerate}

Notice how we used \texttt{computer\ code} font to describe the actions we want to take on our data frames. This is because the \texttt{dplyr} package for data wrangling that we'll introduce in this chapter has intuitively verb-named functions that are easy to remember.

We'll start by introducing the pipe operator \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}, which allows you to combine multiple data wrangling verb-named functions into a single sequential \emph{chain} of actions.

\hypertarget{needed-packages-1}{%
\subsection*{Needed packages}\label{needed-packages-1}}


Let's load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you've already installed them). If needed, read Section \ref{packages} for information on how to install and load R packages.

\begin{Shaded}

\hypertarget{piping}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{The pipe operator: \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}}{The pipe operator: \%\textgreater{}\%}}\label{piping}}

Before we start data wrangling, let's first introduce a very nifty tool that gets loaded along with the \texttt{dplyr} package: the pipe operator \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}. Say you would like to perform a hypothetical sequence of operations on a hypothetical data frame \texttt{x} using hypothetical functions \texttt{f()}, \texttt{g()}, and \texttt{h()}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Take \texttt{x} \emph{then}
\item
  Use \texttt{x} as an input to a function \texttt{f()} \emph{then}
\item
  Use the output of \texttt{f(x)} as an input to a function \texttt{g()} \emph{then}
\item
  Use the output of \texttt{g(f(x))} as an input to a function \texttt{h()}
\end{enumerate}

One way to achieve this sequence of operations is by using nesting parentheses as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{h}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{g}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{f}\NormalTok{(x)))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The above code isn't so hard to read since we are applying only three functions: \texttt{f()}, then \texttt{g()}, then \texttt{h()}. However, you can imagine that this can get progressively harder and harder to read as the number of functions applied in your sequence increases. This is where the pipe operator \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%} comes in handy. \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%} takes one output of one function and then ``pipes'' it to be the input of the next function. Furthermore, a helpful trick is to read \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%} as ``then.'' For example, you can obtain the same output as the above sequence of operations as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{f}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{g}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{h}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You would read this above sequence as:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Take \texttt{x} \emph{then}
\item
  Use this output as the input to the next function \texttt{f()} \emph{then}
\item
  Use this output as the input to the next function \texttt{g()} \emph{then}
\item
  Use this output as the input to the next function \texttt{h()}
\end{enumerate}

So while both approaches above would achieve the same goal, the latter is much more human-readable because you can read the sequence of operations line-by-line. But what are the hypothetical \texttt{x}, \texttt{f()}, \texttt{g()}, and \texttt{h()}? Throughout this chapter on data wrangling:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The starting value \texttt{x} will be a data frame. For example: \texttt{flights}.
\item
  The sequence of functions, here \texttt{f()}, \texttt{g()}, and \texttt{h()}, will be a sequence of any number of the 6 data wrangling verb-named functions we listed in the introduction to this chapter. For example: \texttt{filter(carrier\ ==\ "AS")}.
\item
  The result will the transformed/modified data frame that you want. For example: a data frame consisting of only the subset of rows in \texttt{flights} corresponding to Alaska Airlines flights.
\end{itemize}

Much like when adding layers to a \texttt{ggplot()} using the \texttt{+} sign at the end of lines, you form a single \emph{chain} of data wrangling operations by combining verb-named functions into a single sequence with pipe operators \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%} at the end of lines. So continuing our example involving Alaska Airlines flights, we form a chain using the pipe operator \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%} and save the resulting data frame in \texttt{alaska\_flights}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{alaska_flights <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(carrier }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "AS"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Keep in mind, there are many more advanced data wrangling functions than just the 6 listed in the introduction to this chapter; you'll see some examples of these near in Section \ref{other-verbs}. However, just with these 6 verb-named functions you'll be able to perform a broad array of data wrangling tasks for the rest of this book.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{filter}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{filter} rows}{filter rows}}\label{filter}}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/filter} 

}

\caption{Diagram of }\label{fig:filter}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{filter()} function here works much like the ``Filter'' option in Microsoft Excel; it allows you to specify criteria about the values of a variables in your dataset and then filters out only those rows that match that criteria. We begin by focusing only on flights from New York City to Portland, Oregon. The \texttt{dest} code (or airport code) for Portland, Oregon is \texttt{"PDX"}. Run the following and look at the resulting spreadsheet to ensure that only flights heading to Portland are chosen here:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{portland_flights <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(dest }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "PDX"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(portland_flights)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The ordering of the commands:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Take the \texttt{flights} data frame \texttt{flights} \emph{then}
  \item
    \texttt{filter} the data frame so that only those where the \texttt{dest} equals \texttt{"PDX"} are included.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  We test for equality using the double equal sign \texttt{==} and not a single equal sign \texttt{=}. In other words \texttt{filter(dest\ =\ "PDX")} will yield an error. This is a convention across many programming languages. If you are new to coding, you'll probably forget to use the double equal sign \texttt{==} a few times before you get the hang of it.
\end{itemize}

You can use other mathematical operations beyond just \texttt{==} to form criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{\textgreater{}} corresponds to ``greater than''
\item
  \texttt{\textless{}} corresponds to ``less than''
\item
  \texttt{\textgreater{}=} corresponds to ``greater than or equal to''
\item
  \texttt{\textless{}=} corresponds to ``less than or equal to''
\item
  \texttt{!=} corresponds to ``not equal to''. The \texttt{!} is used in many programming languages to indicate ``not''.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, you can combine multiple criteria together using operators that make comparisons:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{\textbar{}} corresponds to ``or''
\item
  \texttt{\&} corresponds to ``and''
\end{itemize}

To see many of these in action, let's filter \texttt{flights} for all rows that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Departed from JFK airport and
\item
  Were heading to Burlington, Vermont (\texttt{"BTV"}) or Seattle, Washington (\texttt{"SEA"}) and
\item
  Departed in the months of October, November, or December.
\end{itemize}

Run the following:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{btv_sea_flights_fall <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(origin }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "JFK"} \OperatorTok{&}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{(dest }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "BTV"} \OperatorTok{|}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{dest }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "SEA"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{&}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{month }\OperatorTok{>=}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(btv_sea_flights_fall)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that even though colloquially speaking one might say ``all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont \emph{and} Seattle, Washington,'' in terms of computer operations, we really mean ``all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont \emph{or} leaving Seattle, Washington.'' For a given row in the data, \texttt{dest} can be ``BTV'', ``SEA'', or something else, but not ``BTV'' and ``SEA'' at the same time. Furthermore, note the careful use of parentheses around the \texttt{dest\ ==\ "BTV"\ \textbar{}\ dest\ ==\ "SEA"}.

We can often skip the use of \texttt{\&} and just separate our conditions with a comma. In other words the code above will return the identical output \texttt{btv\_sea\_flights\_fall} as this code below:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{btv_sea_flights_fall <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(origin }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "JFK"}\NormalTok{, (dest }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "BTV"} \OperatorTok{|}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{dest }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "SEA"}\NormalTok{), month }\OperatorTok{>=}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(btv_sea_flights_fall)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's present another example that uses the \texttt{!} ``not'' operator to pick rows that \emph{don't} match a criteria. As mentioned earlier, the \texttt{!} can be read as ``not.'' Here we are filtering rows corresponding to flights that didn't go to Burlington, VT or Seattle, WA.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{not_BTV_SEA <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{!}\NormalTok{(dest }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "BTV"} \OperatorTok{|}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{dest }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "SEA"}\NormalTok{))}
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(not_BTV_SEA)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Again, note the careful use of parentheses around the \texttt{(dest\ ==\ "BTV"\ \textbar{}\ dest\ ==\ "SEA")}. If we didn't use parentheses as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{!}\NormalTok{dest }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "BTV"} \OperatorTok{|}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{dest }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "SEA"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We would be returning all flights not headed to \texttt{"BTV"} \emph{or} those headed to \texttt{"SEA"}, which is an entirely different resulting data frame.

Now say we have a large list of airports we want to filter for, say \texttt{BTV}, \texttt{SEA}, \texttt{PDX}, \texttt{SFO}, and \texttt{BDL}. We could continue to use the \texttt{\textbar{}} or operator as so:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{many_airports <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(dest }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "BTV"} \OperatorTok{|}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{dest }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "SEA"} \OperatorTok{|}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{dest }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "PDX"} \OperatorTok{|}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{dest }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "SFO"} \OperatorTok{|}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{dest }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "BDL"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(many_airports)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

but as we progressively include more airports, this will get unwieldy. A slightly shorter approach uses the \texttt{\%in\%} operator:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{many_airports <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(dest }\OperatorTok{%in%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"BTV"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"SEA"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"PDX"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"SFO"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"BDL"}\NormalTok{))}
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(many_airports)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

What this code is doing is filtering \texttt{flights} for all flights where \texttt{dest} is in the list of airports \texttt{c("BTV",\ "SEA",\ "PDX",\ "SFO",\ "BDL")}. Recall from Chapter \ref{getting-started} that the \texttt{c()} function ``combines'' or ``concatenates'' values in a vector of values. Both outputs of \texttt{many\_airports} are the same, but as you can see the latter takes much less time to code.

As a final note we point out that \texttt{filter()} should often be among the first verbs you apply to your data. This cleans your dataset to only those rows you care about, or put differently, it narrows down the scope of your data frame to just the observations your care about.

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC4.1)} What's another way of using the ``not'' operator \texttt{!} to filter only the rows that are not going to Burlington VT nor Seattle WA in the \texttt{flights} data frame? Test this out using the code above.

\hypertarget{summarize}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{summarize} variables}{summarize variables}}\label{summarize}}

The next common task when working with data is to return \emph{summary statistics}: a single numerical value that summarizes a large number of values, for example the mean/average or the median. Other examples of summary statistics that might not immediately come to mind include the sum, the smallest value AKA the minimum, the largest value AKA the maximum, and the standard deviation; they are all summaries of a large number of values.

\begin{figure}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/summary}

\caption{Another summarize diagram from Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet}\label{fig:sum2}
\end{figure}

Let's calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the temperature variable \texttt{temp} in the \texttt{weather} data frame included in the \texttt{nycflights13} package (See Appendix \ref{appendixA}). We'll do this in one step using the \texttt{summarize()} function from the \texttt{dplyr} package and save the results in a new data frame \texttt{summary\_temp} with columns/variables \texttt{mean} and the \texttt{std\_dev}. Note you can also use the UK spelling of ``summarise'' using the \texttt{summarise()} function.

As shown in Figures \ref{fig:sum1} and \ref{fig:sum2}, the \texttt{weather} data frame's many rows will be collapsed into a single row of just the summary values, in this case the mean and standard deviation:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{summary_temp <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{weather }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{mean =} \KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(temp), }\DataTypeTok{std_dev =} \KeywordTok{sd}\NormalTok{(temp))}
\NormalTok{summary_temp}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 2
   mean std_dev
  <dbl>   <dbl>
1    NA      NA
\end{verbatim}

Why are the values returned \texttt{NA}? As we saw in Section \ref{geompoint} when creating the scatterplot of departure and arrival delays for \texttt{alaska\_flights}, \texttt{NA} is how R encodes \emph{missing values} where \texttt{NA} indicates ``not available'' or ``not applicable.'' If a value for a particular row and a particular column does not exist, \texttt{NA} is stored instead. Values can be missing for many reasons. Perhaps the data was collected but someone forgot to enter it? Perhaps the data was not collected at all because it was too difficult? Perhaps there was an erroneous value that someone entered that has been correct to read as missing? You'll often encounter issues with missing values when working with real data.

Going back to our \texttt{summary\_temp} output above, by default any time you try to calculate a summary statistic of a variable that has one or more \texttt{NA} missing values in R, then \texttt{NA} is returned. To work around this fact, you can set the \texttt{na.rm} argument to \texttt{TRUE}, where \texttt{rm} is short for ``remove''; this will ignore any \texttt{NA} missing values and only return the summary value for all non-missing values.

The code below computes the mean and standard deviation of all non-missing values of \texttt{temp}. Notice how the \texttt{na.rm=TRUE} are used as arguments to the \texttt{mean()} and \texttt{sd()} functions individually, and not to the \texttt{summarize()} function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{summary_temp <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{weather }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{mean =} \KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(temp, }\DataTypeTok{na.rm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{), }
            \DataTypeTok{std_dev =} \KeywordTok{sd}\NormalTok{(temp, }\DataTypeTok{na.rm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{summary_temp}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 2
   mean std_dev
  <dbl>   <dbl>
1  55.3    17.8
\end{verbatim}

However, one needs to be cautious whenever ignoring missing values as we've done above. In the upcoming Learning Checks we'll consider the possible ramifications of blindly sweeping rows with missing values ``under the rug.'' This is in fact why the \texttt{na.rm} argument to any summary statistic function in R has is set to \texttt{FALSE} by default; in other words, do not ignore rows with missing values by default. R is alerting you to the presence of missing data and you should by mindful of this missingness and any potential causes of this missingness throughtout your analysis.

What are other summary statistic functions can we use inside the \texttt{summarize()} verb? As seen in Figure \ref{fig:sum2}, you can use any function in R that takes many values and returns just one. Here are just a few:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{mean()}: the mean AKA the average
\item
  \texttt{sd()}: the standard deviation, which is a measure of spread
\item
  \texttt{min()} and \texttt{max()}: the minimum and maximum values respectively
\item
  \texttt{IQR()}: Interquartile range
\item
  \texttt{sum()}: the sum
\item
  \texttt{n()}: a count of the number of rows/observations in each group. This particular summary function will make more sense when \texttt{group\_by()} is covered in Section \ref{groupby}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{(LC4.2)} Say a doctor is studying the effect of smoking on lung cancer for a large number of patients who have records measured at five year intervals. She notices that a large number of patients have missing data points because the patient has died, so she chooses to ignore these patients in her analysis. What is wrong with this doctor's approach?

\textbf{(LC4.3)} Modify the above \texttt{summarize} function to create \texttt{summary\_temp} to also use the \texttt{n()} summary function: \texttt{summarize(count\ =\ n())}. What does the returned value correspond to?

\textbf{(LC4.4)} Why doesn't the following code work? Run the code line by line instead of all at once, and then look at the data. In other words, run \texttt{summary\_temp\ \textless{}-\ weather\ \%\textgreater{}\%\ summarize(mean\ =\ mean(temp,\ na.rm\ =\ TRUE))} first.

Say instead of the a single mean temperature for the whole year, you would like 12 mean temperatures, one for each of the 12 months separately? In other words, we would like to compute the mean temperature split by month AKA sliced by month AKA aggregated by month. We can do this by ``grouping'' temperature observations by the values of another variable, in this case by the 12 values of the variable \texttt{month}. Run the following code:

This code is identical to the previous code that created \texttt{summary\_temp}, but with an extra \texttt{group\_by(month)} added before the \texttt{summarize()}. Grouping the \texttt{weather} dataset by \texttt{month} and then applying the \texttt{summarize()} functions yields a data frame that displays the mean and standard deviation temperature split by the 12 months of the year.

It is important to note that the \texttt{group\_by()} function doesn't change data frames by itself. Rather it changes the \emph{meta-data}, or data about the data, specifically the group structure. It is only after we apply the \texttt{summarize()} function that the data frame changes. For example, let's consider the \texttt{diamonds} data frame included in the \texttt{ggplot2} package. Run this code, specifically in the console:

Observe that the first line of the output reads \texttt{\#\ A\ tibble:\ 53,940\ x\ 10}. This is an example of meta-data, in this case the number of observations/rows and variables/columns in \texttt{diamonds}. The actual data itself are the subsequent table of values.

Now let's pipe the \texttt{diamonds} data frame into \texttt{group\_by(cut)}. Run this code, specifically in the console:

Observe that now there is additional meta-data: \texttt{\#\ Groups:\ cut\ {[}5{]}} indicating that the grouping structure meta-data has been set based on the 5 possible values AKA levels of the categorical variable \texttt{cut}: \texttt{"Fair"}, \texttt{"Good"}, \texttt{"Very\ Good"}, \texttt{"Premium"}, \texttt{"Ideal"}. On the other hand observe that the data has not changed: it is still a table of 53,940 \(\times\) 10 values.

Only by combining a \texttt{group\_by()} with another data wrangling operation, in this case \texttt{summarize()} will the actual data be transformed.

If we would like to remove this group structure meta-data, we can pipe the resulting data frame into the \texttt{ungroup()} function. Observe how the \texttt{\#\ Groups:\ cut\ {[}5{]}} meta-data is no longer present. Run this code, specifically in the console:

Let's now revisit the \texttt{n()} counting summary function we introduced in the previous section. For example, suppose we'd like to count how many flights departed each of the three airports in New York City:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{by_origin <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(origin) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{count =} \KeywordTok{n}\NormalTok{())}
\NormalTok{by_origin}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 3 x 2
  origin  count
  <chr>   <int>
1 EWR    120835
2 JFK    111279
3 LGA    104662
\end{verbatim}

We see that Newark (\texttt{"EWR"}) had the most flights departing in 2013 followed by \texttt{"JFK"} and lastly by LaGuardia (\texttt{"LGA"}). Note there is a subtle but important difference between \texttt{sum()} and \texttt{n()}; While \texttt{sum()} returns the sum of a numerical variable, \texttt{n()} returns counts of the the number of rows/observations.

\hypertarget{grouping-by-more-than-one-variable}{%
\subsection{Grouping by more than one variable}\label{grouping-by-more-than-one-variable}}

You are not limited to grouping by one variable! Say you wanted to know the number of flights leaving each of the three New York City airports \emph{for each month}, we can also group by a second variable \texttt{month}: \texttt{group\_by(origin,\ month)}. We see there are 36 rows to \texttt{by\_origin\_monthly} because there are 12 months for 3 airports (\texttt{EWR}, \texttt{JFK}, and \texttt{LGA}).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{by_origin_monthly <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{count =} \KeywordTok{n}\NormalTok{())}
\NormalTok{by_origin_monthly}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 36 x 3
# Groups:   origin [3]
   origin month count
   <chr>  <int> <int>

 9 EWR        9  9550
10 EWR       10 10104
# ... with 26 more rows
\end{verbatim}

Why do we \texttt{group\_by(origin,\ month)} and not \texttt{group\_by(origin)} and then \texttt{group\_by(month)}? Let's investigate:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{by_origin_monthly_incorrect <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(origin) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(month) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{count =} \KeywordTok{n}\NormalTok{())}
\NormalTok{by_origin_monthly_incorrect}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 12 x 2
   month count
   <int> <int>
 1     1 27004
 2     2 24951
 3     3 28834
 4     4 28330
 5     5 28796
 6     6 28243
 7     7 29425
 8     8 29327
 9     9 27574
10    10 28889
11    11 27268
12    12 28135
\end{verbatim}

What happened here is that the second \texttt{group\_by(month)} overrode the group structure meta-data of the first \texttt{group\_by(origin)}, so that in the end we are only grouping by \texttt{month}. The lesson here is if you want to \texttt{group\_by()} two or more variables, you should include all these variables in a single \texttt{group\_by()} function call.

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC4.5)} Recall from Chapter \ref{viz} when we looked at plots of temperatures by months in NYC. What does the standard deviation column in the \texttt{summary\_monthly\_temp} data frame tell us about temperatures in New York City throughout the year?

\textbf{(LC4.6)} What code would be required to get the mean and standard deviation temperature for each day in 2013 for NYC?

\textbf{(LC4.7)} Recreate \texttt{by\_monthly\_origin}, but instead of grouping via \texttt{group\_by(origin,\ month)}, group variables in a different order \texttt{group\_by(month,\ origin)}. What differs in the resulting dataset?

\textbf{(LC4.8)} How could we identify how many flights left each of the three airports for each \texttt{carrier}?

\textbf{(LC4.9)} How does the \texttt{filter} operation differ from a \texttt{group\_by} followed by a \texttt{summarize}?

\hypertarget{mutate}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{mutate} existing variables}{mutate existing variables}}\label{mutate}}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/mutate} 

}

\caption{Mutate diagram from Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet}\label{fig:select}
\end{figure}

Another common transformation of data is to create/compute new variables based on existing ones. For example, say you are more comfortable thinking of temperature in degrees Celsius °C and not degrees Farenheit °F. The formula to convert temperatures from °F to °C is:

\[
\text{temp in C} = \frac{\text{temp in F} - 32}{1.8}
\]

We can apply this formula to the \texttt{temp} variable using the \texttt{mutate()} function, which takes existing variables and mutates them to create new ones.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{weather <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{weather }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{temp_in_C =}\NormalTok{ (temp}\DecValTok{-32}\NormalTok{)}\OperatorTok{/}\FloatTok{1.8}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(weather)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that we have overwritten the original \texttt{weather} data frame with a new version that now includes the additional variable \texttt{temp\_in\_C}. In other words, the \texttt{mutate()} command outputs a new data frame which then gets saved over the original \texttt{weather} data frame. Furthermore, note how in \texttt{mutate()} we used \texttt{temp\_in\_C\ =\ (temp-32)/1.8} to create a new variable \texttt{temp\_in\_C}.

Why did we overwrite the data frame \texttt{weather} instead of assigning the result to a new data frame like \texttt{weather\_new}, but on the other hand why did we \emph{not} overwrite \texttt{temp}, but instead created a new variable called \texttt{temp\_in\_C}? As a rough rule of thumb, as long as you are not losing original information that you might need later, it's acceptable practice to overwrite existing data frames. On the other hand, had we used \texttt{mutate(temp\ =\ (temp-32)/1.8)} instead of \texttt{mutate(temp\_in\_C\ =\ (temp-32)/1.8)}, we would have overwritten the original variable \texttt{temp} and lost its values.

Let's compute average monthly temperatures in both °F and °C using the similar \texttt{group\_by()} and \texttt{summarize()} code as in the previous section.

Let's consider another example. Passengers are often frustrated when their flights depart late, but change their mood a bit if pilots can make up some time during the flight to get them to their destination close to the original arrival time. This is commonly referred to as ``gain'' and we will create this variable using the \texttt{mutate()} function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{gain =}\NormalTok{ dep_delay }\OperatorTok{-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{arr_delay)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's take a look at \texttt{dep\_delay}, \texttt{arr\_delay}, and the resulting \texttt{gain} variables for the first 5 rows in our new \texttt{flights} data frame:

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 5 x 3
  dep_delay arr_delay  gain
      <dbl>     <dbl> <dbl>
1         2        11    -9
2         4        20   -16
3         2        33   -31
4        -1       -18    17
5        -6       -25    19
\end{verbatim}

The flight in the first row departed 2 minutes late but arrived 11 minutes late, so its ``gained time in the air'' is actually a loss of 9 minutes, hence its \texttt{gain} is \texttt{-9}. Contrast this to the flight in the fourth row which departed a minute early (\texttt{dep\_delay} of \texttt{-1}) but arrived 18 minutes early (\texttt{arr\_delay} of \texttt{-18}), so its ``gained time in the air'' is 17 minutes, hence its \texttt{gain} is \texttt{+17}.

Let's look at summary measures of this \texttt{gain} variable and even plot it in the form of a histogram:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

We can also create multiple columns at once and even refer to columns that were just created in a new column. Hadley and Garrett produce one such example in Chapter 5 of ``R for Data Science'' \citep{rds2016}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}
    \DataTypeTok{gain =}\NormalTok{ dep_delay }\OperatorTok{-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{arr_delay,}
    \DataTypeTok{hours =}\NormalTok{ air_time }\OperatorTok{/}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{60}\NormalTok{,}
    \DataTypeTok{gain_per_hour =}\NormalTok{ gain }\OperatorTok{/}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{hours}
\NormalTok{  )}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC4.10)} What do positive values of the \texttt{gain} variable in \texttt{flights} correspond to? What about negative values? And what about a zero value?

\textbf{(LC4.11)} Could we create the \texttt{dep\_delay} and \texttt{arr\_delay} columns by simply subtracting \texttt{dep\_time} from \texttt{sched\_dep\_time} and similarly for arrivals? Try the code out and explain any differences between the result and what actually appears in \texttt{flights}.

\textbf{(LC4.12)} What can we say about the distribution of \texttt{gain}? Describe it in a few sentences using the plot and the \texttt{gain\_summary} data frame values.

\hypertarget{arrange}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{arrange} and sort rows}{arrange and sort rows}}\label{arrange}}

One of the most common tasks people working with data would like to perform is sort the data frame's rows in alphanumeric order of the values in a variable/column. For example, when calculating a median by hand requires you to first sort the data from the smallest to highest in value and then identify the ``middle'' value. The \texttt{dplyr} package has a function called \texttt{arrange()} that we will use to sort/reorder a data frame's rows according to the values of the specified variable. This is often used after we have used the \texttt{group\_by()} and \texttt{summarize()} functions as we will see.

Let's suppose we were interested in determining the most frequent destination airports for all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2013:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{freq_dest <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(dest) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{num_flights =} \KeywordTok{n}\NormalTok{())}
\NormalTok{freq_dest}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 105 x 2
   dest  num_flights
   <chr>       <int>
 1 ABQ           254
 2 ACK           265
 3 ALB           439
 4 ANC             8
 5 ATL         17215
 6 AUS          2439
 7 AVL           275
 8 BDL           443
 9 BGR           375
10 BHM           297
# ... with 95 more rows
\end{verbatim}

Observe that by default the rows of the resulting \texttt{freq\_dest} data frame are sorted in alphabetical order of \texttt{dest} destination. Say instead we would like to see the same data, but sorted from the most to the least number of flights \texttt{num\_flights} instead:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{freq_dest }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{arrange}\NormalTok{(num_flights)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 105 x 2
   dest  num_flights
   <chr>       <int>
 1 LEX             1
 2 LGA             1
 3 ANC             8
 4 SBN            10
 5 HDN            15
 6 MTJ            15
 7 EYW            17
 8 PSP            19
 9 JAC            25
10 BZN            36
# ... with 95 more rows
\end{verbatim}

This is actually giving us the opposite of what we are looking for: the rows are sorted with the least frequent destination airports displayed first. To switch the ordering to be descending instead of ascending we use the \texttt{desc()} function, which is short for ``descending'':

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{freq_dest }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{arrange}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{desc}\NormalTok{(num_flights))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 105 x 2
   dest  num_flights
   <chr>       <int>
 1 ORD         17283
 2 ATL         17215
 3 LAX         16174
 4 BOS         15508
 5 MCO         14082
 6 CLT         14064
 7 SFO         13331
 8 FLL         12055
 9 MIA         11728
10 DCA          9705
# ... with 95 more rows
\end{verbatim}

In other words, \texttt{arrange()} sorts in ascending order by default unless you override this default behavior by using \texttt{desc()}.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{joins}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{join} data frames}{join data frames}}\label{joins}}

Another common data transformation task is ``joining'' or ``merging'' two different datasets. For example in the \texttt{flights} data frame the variable \texttt{carrier} lists the carrier code for the different flights. While the corresponding airline names for \texttt{"UA"} and \texttt{"AA"} might be somewhat easy to guess (United and American Airlines), what airlines have codes? \texttt{"VX"}, \texttt{"HA"}, and \texttt{"B6"}? This information is provided in a separate data frame \texttt{airlines}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(airlines)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We see that in \texttt{airports}, \texttt{carrier} is the carrier code while \texttt{name} is the full name of the airline company. Using this table, we can see that \texttt{"VX"}, \texttt{"HA"}, and \texttt{"B6"} correspond to Virgin America, Hawaiian Airlines, and JetBlue respectively. However, wouldn't it be nice to have all this information in a single data frame instead of two separate data frames? We can do this by ``joining'' i.e. ``merging'' the \texttt{flights} and \texttt{airlines} data frames.

Note that the values in the variable \texttt{carrier} in the \texttt{flights} data frame match the values in the variable \texttt{carrier} in the \texttt{airlines} data frame. In this case, we can use the variable \texttt{carrier} as a \emph{key variable} to match the rows of the two data frames. Key variables are almost always identification variables that uniquely identify the observational units as we saw in Subsection \ref{identification-vs-measurement-variables}. This ensures that rows in both data frames are appropriately matched during the join. Hadley and Garrett \citep{rds2016} created the following diagram to help us understand how the different datasets are linked by various key variables:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/relational-nycflights} 

}

\caption{Data relationships in nycflights13 from R for Data Science}\label{fig:reldiagram}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{matching-key-variable-names}{%
\subsection{Matching ``key'' variable names}\label{matching-key-variable-names}}

In both the \texttt{flights} and \texttt{airlines} data frames, the key variable we want to join/merge/match the rows of the two data frames by have the same name: \texttt{carriers}. We make use of the \texttt{inner\_join()} function to join the two data frames, where the rows will be matched by the variable \texttt{carrier}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights_joined <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{inner_join}\NormalTok{(airlines, }\DataTypeTok{by =} \StringTok{"carrier"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(flights)}
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(flights_joined)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Observe that the \texttt{flights} and \texttt{flights\_joined} data frames are identical except that \texttt{flights\_joined} has an additional variable \texttt{name} whose values correspond to the airline company names drawn from the \texttt{airlines} data frame.

A visual representation of the \texttt{inner\_join()} is given below \citep{rds2016}. There are other types of joins available (such as \texttt{left\_join()}, \texttt{right\_join()}, \texttt{outer\_join()}, and \texttt{anti\_join()}), but the \texttt{inner\_join()} will solve nearly all of the problems you'll encounter in this book.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/join-inner} 

}

\caption{Diagram of inner join from R for Data Science}\label{fig:ijdiagram}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{diff-key}{%
\subsection{Different ``key'' variable names}\label{diff-key}}

Say instead you are interested in the destinations of all domestic flights departing NYC in 2013 and ask yourself:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``What cities are these airports in?''
\item
  ``Is \texttt{"ORD"} Orlando?''
\item
  "Where is \texttt{"FLL"}?
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{airports} data frame contains airport codes:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(airports)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However, looking at both the \texttt{airports} and \texttt{flights} frames and the visual representation of the relations between these data frames in Figure \ref{fig:ijdiagram} above, we see that in:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the \texttt{airports} data frame the airport code is in the variable \texttt{faa}
\item
  the \texttt{flights} data frame the airport codes are in the variables \texttt{origin} and \texttt{dest}
\end{itemize}

So to join these two data frames so that we can identify the destination cities for example, our \texttt{inner\_join()} operation will use the \texttt{by\ =\ c("dest"\ =\ "faa")} argument, which allows us to join two data frames where the key variable has a different name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights_with_airport_names <-}\StringTok{  }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{inner_join}\NormalTok{(airports, }\DataTypeTok{by =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"dest"}\NormalTok{ =}\StringTok{ "faa"}\NormalTok{))}
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(flights_with_airport_names)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's construct the sequence of commands that computes the number of flights from NYC to each destination, but also includes information about each destination airport:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{named_dests <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(dest) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{num_flights =} \KeywordTok{n}\NormalTok{()) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{arrange}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{desc}\NormalTok{(num_flights)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{inner_join}\NormalTok{(airports, }\DataTypeTok{by =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"dest"}\NormalTok{ =}\StringTok{ "faa"}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{rename}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{airport_name =}\NormalTok{ name)}
\NormalTok{named_dests}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 101 x 9
   dest  num_flights airport_name   lat    lon   alt    tz dst

 6 CLT         14064 Charlotte D~  35.2  -80.9   748    -5 A

10 DCA          9705 Ronald Reag~  38.9  -77.0    15    -5 A    
# ... with 91 more rows, and 1 more variable: tzone <chr>
\end{verbatim}

In case you didn't know, \texttt{"ORD"} is the airport code of Chicago O'Hare airport and \texttt{"FLL"} is the main airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which we can now see in the \texttt{airport\_name} variable in the resulting \texttt{named\_dests} data frame.

\hypertarget{multiple-key-variables}{%
\subsection{Multiple ``key'' variables}\label{multiple-key-variables}}

Say instead we are in a situation where we need to join by multiple variables. For example, in Figure \ref{fig:reldiagram} above we see that in order to join the \texttt{flights} and \texttt{weather} data frames, we need more than one key variable: \texttt{year}, \texttt{month}, \texttt{day}, \texttt{hour}, and \texttt{origin}. This is because the combination of these 5 variables act to uniquely identify each observational unit in the \texttt{weather} data frame: hourly weather recordings at each of the 3 NYC airports.

We achieve this by specifying a vector of key variables to join by using the \texttt{c()} function for ``combine'' or ``concatenate'' that we saw earlier:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights_weather_joined <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{inner_join}\NormalTok{(weather, }\DataTypeTok{by =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"year"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"month"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"day"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"hour"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"origin"}\NormalTok{))}
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(flights_weather_joined)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC4.13)} Looking at Figure \ref{fig:reldiagram}, when joining \texttt{flights} and \texttt{weather} (or, in other words, matching the hourly weather values with each flight), why do we need to join by all of \texttt{year}, \texttt{month}, \texttt{day}, \texttt{hour}, and \texttt{origin}, and not just \texttt{hour}?

\textbf{(LC4.14)} What surprises you about the top 10 destinations from NYC in 2013?

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

\hypertarget{normal-forms}{%
\subsection{Normal forms}\label{normal-forms}}

The data frames included in the \texttt{nycflights13} package are in a form that minimizes redundancy of data. For example, the \texttt{flights} data frame only saves the \texttt{carrier} code of the airline company; it does not include the actual name of the airline. For example the first row of \texttt{flights} has \texttt{carrier} equal to \texttt{UA}, but does it does not include the airline name ``United Air Lines Inc.'' The names of the airline companies are included in the \texttt{name} variable of the \texttt{airlines} data frame. In order to have the airline company name included in \texttt{flights}, we could join these two data frames as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{joined_flights <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{inner_join}\NormalTok{(airlines, }\DataTypeTok{by =} \StringTok{"carrier"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(joined_flights)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We are capable of performing this join because each of the data frames have \emph{keys} in common to relate one to another: the \texttt{carrier} variable in both the \texttt{flights} and \texttt{airlines} data frames. The \emph{key} variable(s) that we join are often \emph{identification variables} we mentioned previously.

This is an important property of what's known as \textbf{normal forms} of data. The process of decomposing data frames into less redundant tables without losing information is called \textbf{normalization}. More information is available on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization}{Wikipedia}.

\hypertarget{other-verbs}{%
\section{Other verbs}\label{other-verbs}}

Here are some other useful data wrangling verbs that might come in handy:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{select()} only a subset of variables/columns
\item
  \texttt{rename()} variables/columns to have new names
\item
  Return only the \texttt{top\_n()} values of a variable
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{select}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{select} variables}{select variables}}\label{select}}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/select} 

}

\caption{Select diagram from Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet}\label{fig:selectfig}
\end{figure}

We've seen that the \texttt{flights} data frame in the \texttt{nycflights13} package contains 19 different variables. You can identify the names of these 19 variables by running the \texttt{glimpse()} function from the \texttt{dplyr} package:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{glimpse}\NormalTok{(flights)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However, say you only need two of these variables, say \texttt{carrier} and \texttt{flight}. You can \texttt{select()} these two variables:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(carrier, flight)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This function makes exploring data frames with a very large number of variables easier for humans to process by restricting consideration to only those we care about, like our example with \texttt{carrier} and \texttt{flight} above. This might make viewing the dataset using the \texttt{View()} spreadsheet viewer more digestible. However, as far as the computer is concerned, it doesn't care how many additional variables are in the data frame in question, so long as \texttt{carrier} and \texttt{flight} are included.

Let's say instead you want to drop i.e deselect certain variables. For example, take the variable \texttt{year} in the \texttt{flights} data frame. This variable isn't quite a ``variable'' in the sense that all the values are \texttt{2013} i.e.~it doesn't change. Say you want to remove the \texttt{year} variable from the data frame; we can deselect \texttt{year} by using the \texttt{-} sign:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights_no_year <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{year)}
\KeywordTok{glimpse}\NormalTok{(flights_no_year)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Another way of selecting columns/variables is by specifying a range of columns:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flight_arr_times <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(month}\OperatorTok{:}\NormalTok{day, arr_time}\OperatorTok{:}\NormalTok{sched_arr_time)}
\NormalTok{flight_arr_times}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{select()} function can also be used to reorder columns in combination with the \texttt{everything()} helper function. Let's suppose we'd like the \texttt{hour}, \texttt{minute}, and \texttt{time\_hour} variables, which appear at the end of the \texttt{flights} dataset, to appear immediately after the \texttt{year}, \texttt{month}, and \texttt{day} variables while keeping the rest of the variables. In the code below \texttt{everything()} picks up all remaining variables.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights_reorder <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(year, month, day, hour, minute, time_hour, }\KeywordTok{everything}\NormalTok{())}
\KeywordTok{glimpse}\NormalTok{(flights_reorder)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Lastly, the helper functions \texttt{starts\_with()}, \texttt{ends\_with()}, and \texttt{contains()} can be used to select variables/column that match those conditions. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights_begin_a <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{starts_with}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"a"}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{flights_begin_a}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights_delays <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{ends_with}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"delay"}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{flights_delays}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights_time <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{contains}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"time"}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{flights_time}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{rename}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{rename} variables}{rename variables}}\label{rename}}

Another useful function is \texttt{rename()}, which as you may have guessed renames one column to another name. Suppose we want \texttt{dep\_time} and \texttt{arr\_time} to be \texttt{departure\_time} and \texttt{arrival\_time} instead in the \texttt{flights\_time} data frame:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{flights_time_new <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{contains}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"time"}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{rename}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{departure_time =}\NormalTok{ dep_time,}
         \DataTypeTok{arrival_time =}\NormalTok{ arr_time)}
\KeywordTok{glimpse}\NormalTok{(flights_time)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that in this case we used a single \texttt{=} sign within the \texttt{rename()}, for example \texttt{departure\_time\ =\ dep\_time}. This is because we are not testing for equality like we would using \texttt{==}, but instead we want to assign a new variable \texttt{departure\_time} to have the same values as \texttt{dep\_time} and then delete the variable \texttt{dep\_time}. It's easy to forget if the new name comes before or after the equals sign. I usually remember this as ``New Before, Old After'' or NBOA.

\hypertarget{top_n-values-of-a-variable}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{top\_n} values of a variable}{top\_n values of a variable}}\label{top_n-values-of-a-variable}}

We can also return the top \texttt{n} values of a variable using the \texttt{top\_n()} function. For example, we can return a data frame of the top 10 destination airports using the example from Section \ref{diff-key}. Observe that we set the number of values to return to \texttt{n\ =\ 10} and \texttt{wt\ =\ num\_flights} to indicate that we want the rows of corresponding to the top 10 values of \texttt{num\_flights}. See the help file for \texttt{top\_n()} by running \texttt{?top\_n} for more information.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{named_dests }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{top_n}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{n =} \DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{wt =}\NormalTok{ num_flights)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's further \texttt{arrange()} these results in descending order of \texttt{num\_flights}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{named_dests  }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{top_n}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{n =} \DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{wt =}\NormalTok{ num_flights) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{arrange}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{desc}\NormalTok{(num_flights))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's recap our data wrangling verbs in Table \ref{tab:wrangle-summary-table}. Using these verbs and the pipe \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%} operator from Section \ref{piping}, you'll be able to write easily legible code to perform almost all the data wrangling necessary for the rest of this book.

\textbf{(LC4.20)} Let's now put your newly acquired data wrangling skills to the test!

An airline industry measure of a passenger airline's capacity is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Available_seat_miles}{available seat miles}, which is equal to the number of seats available multiplied by the number of miles or kilometers flown summed over all flights. So for example say an airline had 2 flights using a plane with 10 seats that flew 500 miles and 3 flights using a plane with 20 seats that flew 1000 miles, the available seat miles would be 2 \(\times\) 10 \(\times\) 500 \(+\) 3 \(\times\) 20 \(\times\) 1000 = 70,000 seat miles.

Using the datasets included in the \texttt{nycflights13} package, compute the available seat miles for each airline sorted in descending order. After completing all the necessary data wrangling steps, the resulting data frame should have 16 rows (one for each airline) and 2 columns (airline name and available seat miles). Here are some hints:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Crucial}: Unless you are very confident in what you are doing, it is worthwhile to not starting coding right away, but rather first sketch out on paper all the necessary data wrangling steps not using exact code, but rather high-level \emph{pseudocode} that is informal yet detailed enough to articulate what you are doing. This way you won't confuse \emph{what} you are trying to do (the algorithm) with \emph{how} you are going to do it (writing \texttt{dplyr} code).
\item
  Take a close look at all the datasets using the \texttt{View()} function: \texttt{flights}, \texttt{weather}, \texttt{planes}, \texttt{airports}, and \texttt{airlines} to identify which variables are necessary to compute available seat miles.
\item
  Figure \ref{fig:reldiagram} above showing how the various datasets can be joined will also be useful.
\item
  Consider the data wrangling verbs in Table \ref{tab:wrangle-summary-table} as your toolbox!

\subsection{Additional resources}\label{additional-resources-2}}

An R script file of all R code used in this chapter is available \href{scripts/04-wrangling.R}{here}.

If you want to further unlock the power of the \texttt{dplyr} package for data wrangling, we suggest you that you check out RStudio's ``Data Transformation with dplyr'' cheatsheet. This cheatsheet summarizes much more than what we've discussed in this chapter, in particular more-intermediate level and advanced data wrangling functions, while providing quick and easy to read visual descriptions.

You can access this cheatsheet by going to the RStudio Menu Bar -\textgreater{} Help -\textgreater{} Cheatsheets -\textgreater{} ``Data Transformation with dplyr'':

On top of data wrangling verbs and examples we presented in this section, if you'd like to see more examples of using the \texttt{dplyr} package for data wrangling check out \href{http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html}{Chapter 5} of Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham's and Garrett's book \citep{rds2016}.

\hypertarget{whats-to-come-1}{%
\subsection{What's to come?}\label{whats-to-come-1}}

So far in this book, we've explored, visualized, and wrangled data saved in data frames that are in spreadsheet-type format: rectangular with a certain number of rows corresponding to observations and a certain number of columns corresponding to variables describing the observations.

We'll see in Chapter \ref{tidy} that there are actually two ways to represent data in spreadsheet-type rectangular format: 1) ``wide'' format and 2) ``tall/narrow'' format also known in R circles as ``tidy'' format. While the distinction between ``tidy'' and non-``tidy'' formatted data is very subtle, it has very large implications for whether or not we can use the \texttt{ggplot2} package for data visualization and the \texttt{dplyr} package for data wrangling.

Furthermore, we've only explored, visualized, and wrangled data saved within R packages. What if you have spreadsheet data saved in a Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or ``Comma-Separated Values'' (CSV) file that you would like to analyze? In Chapter \ref{tidy}, we'll show you how to import this data into R using the \texttt{readr} package.

\hypertarget{tidy}{%
\chapter{Data Importing \& ``Tidy'' Data}\label{tidy}}

In Subsection \ref{programming-concepts} we introduced the concept of a data frame: a rectangular spreadsheet-like representation of data in R where the rows correspond to observations and the columns correspond to variables describing each observation. In Section \ref{nycflights13}, we started exploring our first data frame: the \texttt{flights} data frame included in the \texttt{nycflights13} package. In Chapter \ref{viz} we created visualizations based on the data included in \texttt{flights} and other data frames such as \texttt{weather}. In Chapter \ref{wrangling}, we learned how to wrangle data, in other words take existing data frames and transform/ modify them to suit our analysis goals.

In this final chapter of the ``Data Science via the tidyverse'' portion of the book, we extend some of these ideas by discussing a type of data formatting called ``tidy'' data. You will see that having data stored in ``tidy'' format is about more than what the colloquial definition of the term ``tidy'' might suggest: having your data ``neatly organized.'' Instead, we define the term ``tidy'' in a more rigorous fashion, outlining a set of rules by which data can be stored, and the implications of these rules for analyses.

Although knowledge of this type of data formatting was not necessary for our treatment of data visualization in Chapter \ref{viz} and data wrangling in Chapter \ref{wrangling} since all the data was already in ``tidy'' format, we'll now see this format is actually essential to using the tools we covered in these two chapters. Furthermore, it will also be useful for all subsequent chapters in this book when we cover regression and statistical inference. First however, we'll show you how to import spreadsheet data for use in R.

\hypertarget{needed-packages-2}{%
\subsection*{Needed packages}\label{needed-packages-2}}

\hypertarget{csv}{%
\section{Importing data}\label{csv}}

Up to this point, we've almost entirely used data stored inside of an R package. Say instead you have your own data saved on your computer or somewhere online? How can you analyze this data in R? Spreadsheet data is often saved in one of the following formats:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A \emph{Comma Separated Values} \texttt{.csv} file. You can think of a \texttt{.csv} file as a bare-bones spreadsheet where:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Each line in the file corresponds to one row of data/one observation.
  \item
    Values for each line are separated with commas. In other words, the values of different variables are separated by commas.
  \item
    The first line is often, but not always, a \emph{header} row indicating the names of the columns/variables.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  An Excel \texttt{.xlsx} file. This format is based on Microsoft's proprietary Excel software. As opposed to a bare-bones \texttt{.csv} files, \texttt{.xlsx} Excel files contain a lot of meta-data, or put more simply, data about the data. (Recall we saw a previous example of meta-data in Section \ref{groupby} when adding ``group structure'' meta-data to a data frame by using the \texttt{group\_by()} verb.) Some examples of spreadsheet meta-data include the use of bold and italic fonts, colored cells, different column widths, and formula macros.
\item
  A \href{https://www.google.com/sheets/about/}{Google Sheets} file, which is a ``cloud'' or online-based way to work with a spreadsheet. Google Sheets allows you to download your data in both comma separated values \texttt{.csv} and Excel \texttt{.xlsx} formats however: go to the Google Sheets menu bar -\textgreater{} File -\textgreater{} Download as -\textgreater{} Select ``Microsoft Excel'' or ``Comma-separated values.''
\end{itemize}

We'll cover two methods for importing \texttt{.csv} and \texttt{.xlsx} spreadsheet data in R: one using the R console and the other using RStudio's graphical user interface, abbreviated a GUI.

\hypertarget{using-the-console}{%
\subsection{Using the console}\label{using-the-console}}

First, let's import a Comma Separated Values \texttt{.csv} file of data directly off the internet. The \texttt{.csv} file \texttt{dem\_score.csv} accessible at \url{https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv} contains ratings of the level of democracy in different countries spanning 1952 to 1992. Let's use the \texttt{read\_csv()} function from the \texttt{readr} package to read it off the web, import it into R, and save it in a data frame called \texttt{dem\_score}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(readr)}
\NormalTok{dem_score <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{read_csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{dem_score}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 96 x 10
   country `1952` `1957` `1962` `1967` `1972` `1977` `1982`
   <chr>    <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>
 1 Albania     -9     -9     -9     -9     -9     -9     -9
 2 Argent~     -9     -1     -1     -9     -9     -9     -8
 3 Armenia     -9     -7     -7     -7     -7     -7     -7
 4 Austra~     10     10     10     10     10     10     10
 5 Austria     10     10     10     10     10     10     10
 6 Azerba~     -9     -7     -7     -7     -7     -7     -7
 7 Belarus     -9     -7     -7     -7     -7     -7     -7
 8 Belgium     10     10     10     10     10     10     10
 9 Bhutan     -10    -10    -10    -10    -10    -10    -10
10 Bolivia     -4     -3     -3     -4     -7     -7      8
# ... with 86 more rows, and 2 more variables: `1987` <dbl>,
#   `1992` <dbl>
\end{verbatim}

In this \texttt{dem\_score} data frame, the minimum value of \texttt{-10} corresponds to a highly autocratic nation whereas a value of \texttt{10} corresponds to a highly democratic nation. We'll revisit the \texttt{dem\_score} data frame in a case study in the upcoming Section \ref{case-study-tidy}.

Note that the \texttt{read\_csv()} function included in the \texttt{readr} package is different than the \texttt{read.csv()} function that comes installed with R by default. While the difference in the names might seem near meaningless (an \texttt{\_} instead of a \texttt{.}), the \texttt{read\_csv()} function is in our opinion easier to use since it can more easily read data off the web and generally imports data at a much faster speed.

\hypertarget{using-rstudios-interface}{%
\subsection{Using RStudio's interface}\label{using-rstudios-interface}}

Let's read in the exact same data saved in Excel format, but this time via RStudio's graphical interface instead of via the R console. First download the Excel file \texttt{dem\_score.xlsx} by clicking here, then

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to the Files panel of RStudio.
\item
  Navigate to the directory i.e.~folder on your computer where the downloaded \texttt{dem\_score.xlsx} Excel file is saved.
\item
  Click on \texttt{dem\_score.xlsx}.
\item
  Click ``Import Dataset\ldots{}''
\end{enumerate}

At this point you should see an image like this:

\includegraphics{images/read_excel.png}

After clicking on the ``Import'' button on the bottom right RStudio, RStudio will save this spreadsheet's data in a data frame called \texttt{dem\_score} and display its contents in the spreadsheet viewer. Furthermore, note in the bottom right of the above image there exists a ``Code Preview'': you can copy and paste this code to reload your data again later automatically instead of repeating the above manual point-and-click process.

\hypertarget{tidy-data-ex}{%
\section{Tidy data}\label{tidy-data-ex}}

Let's now switch gears and learn about the concept of ``tidy'' data format by starting with a motivating example. Let's consider the \texttt{drinks} data frame included in the \texttt{fivethirtyeight} data. Run the following:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{drinks}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 193 x 5

 8 Armenia            21             179            11
 9 Austra~           261              72           212
10 Austria           279              75           191
# ... with 183 more rows, and 1 more variable:
#   total_litres_of_pure_alcohol <dbl>
\end{verbatim}

After reading the help file by running \texttt{?drinks}, we see that \texttt{drinks} is a data frame containing results from a survey of the average number of servings of beer, spirits, and wine consumed for 193 countries. This data was originally reported on the data journalism website FiveThirtyEight.com in Mona Chalabi's article \href{https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/}{``Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?''}

Let's apply some of the data wrangling verbs we learned in Chapter \ref{wrangling} on the \texttt{drinks} data frame. Let's

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{filter()} the \texttt{drinks} data frame to only consider 4 countries (the United States, China, Italy, and Saudi Arabia) then
\item
  \texttt{select()} all columns except \texttt{total\_litres\_of\_pure\_alcohol} by using \texttt{-} sign, then
\item
  \texttt{rename()} the variables \texttt{beer\_servings}, \texttt{spirit\_servings}, and \texttt{wine\_servings} to \texttt{beer}, \texttt{spirit}, and \texttt{wine} respectively
\end{enumerate}

and save the resulting data frame in \texttt{drinks\_smaller}.

\begin{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 4 x 4

3 Saudi Arabia     0      5     0
4 USA            249    158    84
\end{verbatim}

Using the \texttt{drinks\_smaller} data frame, how would we create the side-by-side AKA dodged barplot in Figure \ref{fig:drinks-smaller}? Recall we saw barplots displaying two categorical variables in Section \ref{two-categ-barplot}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/drinks-smaller-1} 

}

\caption{Alcohol consumption in 4 countries.}\label{fig:drinks-smaller}
\end{figure}

Let's break down the Grammar of Graphics:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The categorical variable \texttt{country} with four levels (China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, USA) would have to be mapped to the \texttt{x}-position of the bars.
\item
  The numerical variable \texttt{servings} would have to be mapped to the \texttt{y}-position of the bars, in other words the height of the bars.
\item
  The categorical variable \texttt{type} with three levels (beer, spirit, wine) who have to be mapped to the \texttt{fill} color of the bars.
\end{enumerate}

Observe however that \texttt{drinks\_smaller} has \emph{three separate variables} for \texttt{beer}, \texttt{spirit}, and \texttt{wine}, whereas in order to recreate the side-by-side AKA dodged barplot in Figure \ref{fig:drinks-smaller} we would need a \emph{single variable} \texttt{type} with three possible values: \texttt{beer}, \texttt{spirit}, and \texttt{wine}, which we would then map to the \texttt{fill} aesthetic. In other words, for us to be able to create the barplot in Figure \ref{fig:drinks-smaller}, our data frame would have to look like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{drinks_smaller_tidy}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 12 x 3

   <chr>        <chr>     <int>
 1 China        beer         79
 2 Italy        beer         85
 3 Saudi Arabia beer          0
 4 USA          beer        249
 5 China        spirit      192
 6 Italy        spirit       42
 7 Saudi Arabia spirit        5
 8 USA          spirit      158
 9 China        wine          8
10 Italy        wine        237
11 Saudi Arabia wine          0
12 USA          wine         84
\end{verbatim}

Let's compare the \texttt{drinks\_smaller\_tidy} with the \texttt{drinks\_smaller} data frame from earlier:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{drinks_smaller}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 4 x 4

1 China           79    192     8
2 Italy           85     42   237
3 Saudi Arabia     0      5     0
4 USA            249    158    84
\end{verbatim}

Observe that while \texttt{drinks\_smaller} and \texttt{drinks\_smaller\_tidy} are both rectangular in shape and contain the same 12 numerical values (3 alcohol types \(\times\) 4 countries), they are formatted differently. \texttt{drinks\_smaller} is formatted in what's known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data}{``wide''} format, whereas \texttt{drinks\_smaller\_tidy} is formatted in what's known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data\#Narrow}{``long/narrow''}. In the context of using R, long/narrow format is also known as ``tidy'' format. Furthermore, in order to use the \texttt{ggplot2} and \texttt{dplyr} packages for data visualization and data wrangling, your input data frames \emph{must} be in ``tidy'' format. So all non-``tidy'' data must be converted to ``tidy'' format first.

Before we show you how to convert non-``tidy'' data frames like \texttt{drinks\_smaller} to ``tidy'' data frames like \texttt{drinks\_smaller\_tidy}, let's go over the explicit definition of ``tidy'' data.

\hypertarget{definition-of-tidy-data}{%
\subsection{Definition of ``tidy'' data}\label{definition-of-tidy-data}}

You have surely heard the word ``tidy'' in your life:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Tidy up your room!''
\item
  ``Please write your homework in a tidy way so that it is easier to grade and to provide feedback.''
\item
  Marie Kondo's best-selling book \href{https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\&qid=1469400636\&sr=8-1\&keywords=tidying+up}{\emph{The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing}} and Netflix TV series \href{https://www.netflix.com/title/80209379}{\emph{Tidying Up with Marie Kondo}}.
\item
  ``I am not by any stretch of the imagination a tidy person, and the piles of unread books on the coffee table and by my bed have a plaintive, pleading quality to me - `Read me, please!'\,'' - Linda Grant
\end{itemize}

What does it mean for your data to be ``tidy''? While ``tidy'' has a clear English meaning of ``organized'', ``tidy'' in the context of data science using R means that your data follows a standardized format. We will follow Hadley Wickham's definition of \emph{tidy data} here \citep{tidy}:

\begin{quote}
A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative)
or strings AKA text data (if qualitative). Values are organised in two ways.
Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all
values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature,
duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same
unit (like a person, or a day, or a city) across attributes.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its
structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables
are matched up with observations, variables and types. In \emph{tidy data}:
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Each variable forms a column.
\item
  Each observation forms a row.
\item
  Each type of observational unit forms a table.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

Date & Boeing Stock Price & Amazon Stock Price & Google Stock Price\\
\midrule
2009-01-01 & \$173.55 & \$174.90 & \$174.34\\
2009-01-02 & \$172.61 & \$171.42 & \$170.04\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Although the data are neatly organized in a rectangular spreadsheet-type format, they are not in tidy format because while there are three variables corresponding to three unique pieces of information (Date, Stock Name, and Stock Price), there are not three columns. In ``tidy'' data format each variable should be its own column, as shown in Table \ref{tab:tidy-stocks}. Notice that both tables present the same information, but in different formats.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:tidy-stocks}Stock Prices (Tidy Format)}
\centering
\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
Date & Stock Name & Stock Price\\
\midrule
2009-01-01 & Boeing & \$173.55\\
2009-01-02 & Boeing & \$172.61\\
2009-01-01 & Amazon & \$174.90\\
2009-01-02 & Amazon & \$171.42\\
2009-01-01 & Google & \$174.34\\
\addlinespace
2009-01-02 & Google & \$170.04\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Now we have the requisite three columns Date, Stock Name, and Stock Price. On the other hand, consider the data in Table \ref{tab:tidy-stocks-2}.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:tidy-stocks-2}Date, Boeing Price, Weather Data}
\centering
\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
Date & Boeing Price & Weather\\
\midrule
2009-01-01 & \$173.55 & Sunny\\
2009-01-02 & \$172.61 & Overcast\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In this case, even though the variable ``Boeing Price'' occurs just like in our non-``tidy'' data in Table \ref{tab:non-tidy-stocks}, the data \emph{is} ``tidy'' since there are three variables corresponding to three unique pieces of information: Date, Boeing stock price, and the weather that particular day.

\subsection{Converting to ``tidy'' data}\label{converting-to-tidy-data}}

In this book so far, you've only seen data frames that were already in ``tidy'' format. Furthermore for the rest of this book, you'll mostly only see data frames that are already in ``tidy'' format as well. This is not always the case however with data in the wild. If your original data frame is in wide i.e.~non-``tidy'' format and you would like to use the \texttt{ggplot2} package for data visualization or the \texttt{dplyr} package for data wrangling, you will first have to convert it ``tidy'' format using the \texttt{gather()} function in the \texttt{tidyr} package \citep{R-tidyr}.

Going back to our \texttt{drinks\_smaller} data frame from earlier:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{drinks_smaller}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 4 x 4
  country       beer spirit  wine
  <chr>        <int>  <int> <int>
1 China           79    192     8
2 Italy           85     42   237
3 Saudi Arabia     0      5     0
4 USA            249    158    84
\end{verbatim}

We convert it to ``tidy'' format by using the \texttt{gather()} function from the \texttt{tidyr} package as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{drinks_smaller_tidy <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{drinks_smaller }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{gather}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{key =}\NormalTok{ type, }\DataTypeTok{value =}\NormalTok{ servings, }\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{country)}
\NormalTok{drinks_smaller_tidy}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 12 x 3
   country      type   servings
   <chr>        <chr>     <int>
 1 China        beer         79
 2 Italy        beer         85
 3 Saudi Arabia beer          0
 4 USA          beer        249
 5 China        spirit      192
 6 Italy        spirit       42
 7 Saudi Arabia spirit        5
 8 USA          spirit      158
 9 China        wine          8
10 Italy        wine        237
11 Saudi Arabia wine          0
12 USA          wine         84
\end{verbatim}

We set the arguments to \texttt{gather()} as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{key} is the name of the column/variable in the new ``tidy'' frame that contains the column names of the original data frame that you want to tidy. Observe how we set \texttt{key\ =\ type} and in the resulting \texttt{drinks\_smaller\_tidy} the column \texttt{type} contains the three types of alcohol \texttt{beer}, \texttt{spirit}, and \texttt{wine}.
\item
  \texttt{value} is the name of the column/variable in the ``tidy'' frame that contains the rows and columns of values in the original data frame you want to tidy. Observe how we set \texttt{value\ =\ servings} and in the resulting \texttt{drinks\_smaller\_tidy} the column \texttt{value} contains the 4 \(\times\) 3 = 12 numerical values.
\item
  The third argument are the columns you either want to or don't want to tidy. Observe how we set this to \texttt{-country} indicating that we don't want to tidy the \texttt{country} variable in \texttt{drinks\_smaller} and rather only \texttt{beer}, \texttt{spirit}, and \texttt{wine}.
\end{enumerate}

The third argument is a little nuanced, so let's consider another example. Note the code below is very similar, but now the third argument species which columns we'd want to tidy \texttt{c(beer,\ spirit,\ wine)}, instead of the columns we don't want to tidy \texttt{-country}. Note the use of \texttt{c()} to create a vector of the columns in \texttt{drinks\_smaller} that we'd like to tidy. If you run the code below, you'll see that the resulting \texttt{drinks\_smaller\_tidy} is the same.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{drinks_smaller_tidy <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{drinks_smaller }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{gather}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{key =}\NormalTok{ type, }\DataTypeTok{value =}\NormalTok{ servings, }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(beer, spirit, wine))}
\NormalTok{drinks_smaller_tidy}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

With our \texttt{drinks\_smaller\_tidy} ``tidy'' format data frame, we can now produce a side-by-side AKA dodged barplot using \texttt{geom\_col()} and not \texttt{geom\_bar()}, since we would like to map the \texttt{servings} variable to the \texttt{y}-aesthetic of the bars.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(drinks_smaller_tidy, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x=}\NormalTok{country, }\DataTypeTok{y=}\NormalTok{servings, }\DataTypeTok{fill=}\NormalTok{type)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_col}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{position =} \StringTok{"dodge"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-128-1} \end{center}

Converting ``wide'' format data to ``tidy'' format often confuses new R users. The only way to learn to get comfortable with the \texttt{gather()} function is with practice, practice, and more practice. For example, see the examples in the bottom of the help file for \texttt{gather()} by running \texttt{?gather}. We'll show another example of using \texttt{gather()} to convert a ``wide'' formatted data frame to ``tidy'' format in Section \ref{case-study-tidy}. For other examples of converting a dataset into ``tidy'' format, check out the different functions available for data tidying and a case study using data from the World Health Organization in \href{http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html}{R for Data Science} \citep{rds2016}.

After reading the help file by running \texttt{?airline\_safety}, we see that \texttt{airline\_safety} is a data frame containing information on different airlines companies' safety records. This data was originally reported on the data journalism website FiveThirtyEight.com in Nate Silver's article \href{https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-travelers-avoid-flying-airlines-that-have-had-crashes-in-the-past/}{``Should Travelers Avoid Flying Airlines That Have Had Crashes in the Past?''}. Let's ignore the \texttt{incl\_reg\_subsidiaries} and \texttt{avail\_seat\_km\_per\_week} variables for simplicity:

This data frame is not in ``tidy'' format. How would you convert this data frame to be in ``tidy'' format, in particular so that it has a variable \texttt{incident\_type\_years} indicating the incident type/year and a variable \texttt{count} of the counts?

\hypertarget{nycflights13-package-1}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{nycflights13} package}{nycflights13 package}}\label{nycflights13-package-1}}

Recall the \texttt{nycflights13} package with data about all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2013 that we introduced in Section \ref{nycflights13} and used extensively in Chapter \ref{viz} on data visualization and Chapter \ref{wrangling} on data wrangling. Let's revisit the \texttt{flights} data frame by running \texttt{View(flights)}. We saw that \texttt{flights} has a rectangular shape with each of its 336,776 rows corresponding to a flight and each of its 22 columns corresponding to different characteristics/measurements of each flight. This matches exactly with our definition of ``tidy'' data from above.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Each variable forms a column.
\item
  Each observation forms a row.
\end{enumerate}

But what about the third property of ``tidy'' data?

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Each type of observational unit forms a table.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

Recall that we also saw in Section \ref{exploredataframes} that the observational unit for the \texttt{flights} data frame is an individual flight. In other words, the rows of the \texttt{flights} data frame refer to characteristics/measurements of individual flights. Also included in the \texttt{nycflights13} package are other data frames with their rows representing different observational units \citep{R-nycflights13}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{airlines}: translation between two letter IATA carrier codes and names (16 in total). i.e.~the observational unit is an airline company.
\item
  \texttt{planes}: construction information about each of 3,322 planes used. i.e.~the observational unit is an aircraft.
\item
  \texttt{weather}: hourly meteorological data (about 8705 observations) for each of the three NYC airports. i.e.~the observational unit is an hourly measurement.
\item
  \texttt{airports}: airport names and locations. i.e.~the observational unit is an airport.
\end{itemize}

The organization of the information into these five data frames follow the third ``tidy'' data property: observations corresponding to the same observational unit should be saved in the same table i.e.~data frame. You could think of this property as the old English expression: ``birds of a feather flock together.''

\hypertarget{case-study-tidy}{%
\section{Case study: Democracy in Guatemala}\label{case-study-tidy}}

In this section, we'll show you another example of how to convert a data frame that isn't in ``tidy'' format i.e. ``wide'' format, to a data frame that is in ``tidy'' format i.e. ``long/narrow'' format. We'll do this using the \texttt{gather()} function from the \texttt{tidyr} package again. Furthermore, we'll make use of some of the \texttt{ggplot2} data visualization and \texttt{dplyr} data wrangling tools you learned in Chapters \ref{viz} and \ref{wrangling}.

Let's use the \texttt{dem\_score} data frame we imported in Section \ref{csv}, but focus on only data corresponding to Guatemala.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{guat_dem <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{dem_score }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(country }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "Guatemala"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{guat_dem}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 10
  country `1952` `1957` `1962` `1967` `1972` `1977` `1982` `1987`
  <chr>    <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>
1 Guatem~      2     -6     -5      3      1     -3     -7      3
# ... with 1 more variable: `1992` <dbl>
\end{verbatim}

Now let's produce a \emph{time-series plot} showing how the democracy scores have changed over the 40 years from 1952 to 1992 for Guatemala. Recall that we saw time-series plot in Section \ref{linegraphs} on creating linegraphs using \texttt{geom\_line()}. Let's lay out the Grammar of Graphics we saw in Section \ref{grammarofgraphics}.

First we know we need to set \texttt{data\ =\ guat\_dem} and use a \texttt{geom\_line()} layer, but what is the aesthetic mapping of variables. We'd like to see how the democracy score has changed over the years, so we need to map:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{year} to the x-position aesthetic and
\item
  \texttt{democracy\_score} to the y-position aesthetic
\end{itemize}

Now we are stuck in a predicament, much like with our \texttt{drinks\_smaller} example in Section \ref{tidy-data-ex}. We see that we have a variable named \texttt{country}, but its only value is \texttt{"Guatemala"}. We have other variables denoted by different year values. Unfortunately, the \texttt{guat\_dem} data frame is not ``tidy'' and hence is not in the appropriate format to apply the Grammar of Graphics and thus we cannot use the \texttt{ggplot2} package. We need to take the values of the columns corresponding to years in \texttt{guat\_dem} and convert them into a new ``key'' variable called \texttt{year}. Furthermore, we'd like to take the democracy scores on the inside of the table and turn them into a new ``value'' variable called \texttt{democracy\_score}. Our resulting data frame will thus have three columns: \texttt{country}, \texttt{year}, and \texttt{democracy\_score}.

Recall that the \texttt{gather()} function in the \texttt{tidyr} package can complete this task for us:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{guat_dem_tidy <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{guat_dem }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{gather}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{key =}\NormalTok{ year, }\DataTypeTok{value =}\NormalTok{ democracy_score, }\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{country) }
\NormalTok{guat_dem_tidy}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 9 x 3
  country   year  democracy_score
  <chr>     <chr>           <dbl>
1 Guatemala 1952                2
2 Guatemala 1957               -6
3 Guatemala 1962               -5
4 Guatemala 1967                3
5 Guatemala 1972                1
6 Guatemala 1977               -3
7 Guatemala 1982               -7
8 Guatemala 1987                3
9 Guatemala 1992                3
\end{verbatim}

We set the arguments to \texttt{gather()} as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{key} is the name of the column/variable in the new ``tidy'' frame that contains the column names of the original data frame that you want to tidy. Observe how we set \texttt{key\ =\ year} and in the resulting \texttt{guat\_dem\_tidy} the column \texttt{year} contains the years where the Guatemala's democracy score were measured.
\item
  \texttt{value} is the name of the column/variable in the ``tidy'' frame that contains the rows and columns of values in the original data frame you want to tidy. Observe how we set \texttt{value\ =\ democracy\_score} and in the resulting \texttt{guat\_dem\_tidy} the column \texttt{democracy\_score} contains the 1 \(\times\) 9 = 9 democracy scores.
\item
  The third argument are the columns you either want to or don't want to tidy. Observe how we set this to \texttt{-country} indicating that we don't want to tidy the \texttt{country} variable in \texttt{guat\_dem} and rather only \texttt{1952} through \texttt{1992}.
\end{enumerate}

However, observe in the output for \texttt{guat\_dem\_tidy} that the \texttt{year} variable is of type \texttt{chr} or character. Before we can plot this variable on the x-axis, we need to convert it into a numerical variable using the \texttt{as.numeric()} function within the \texttt{mutate()} function, which we saw in Section \ref{mutate} on mutating existing variables to create new ones.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{guat_dem_tidy <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{guat_dem_tidy }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{year =} \KeywordTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(year))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can now create the plot to show how the democracy score of Guatemala changed from 1952 to 1992 using a \texttt{geom\_line()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(guat_dem_tidy, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ year, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ democracy_score)) }\OperatorTok{+}

\hypertarget{tidyverse-package}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{tidyverse} package}{tidyverse package}}\label{tidyverse-package}}

Notice at the beginning of the chapter we loaded the following four packages, which are among the four of the most frequently used R packages for data science:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(dplyr)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(ggplot2)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(readr)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyr)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There is a much quicker way to load these packages than by individually loading them as we did above: by installing and loading the \texttt{tidyverse} package. The \texttt{tidyverse} package acts as an ``umbrella'' package whereby installing/loading it will install/load multiple packages at once for you. So after installing the \texttt{tidyverse} package as you would a normal package, running this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

would be the same as running this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(ggplot2)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(dplyr)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyr)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(readr)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(purrr)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(tibble)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(stringr)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(forcats)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You've seen the first 4 of the these packages: \texttt{ggplot2} for data visualization, \texttt{dplyr} for data wrangling, \texttt{tidyr} for converting data to ``tidy'' format, and \texttt{readr} for importing spreadsheet data into R. The remaining packages (\texttt{purrr}, \texttt{tibble}, \texttt{stringr}, and \texttt{forcats}) are left for a more advanced book; check out \href{http://r4ds.had.co.nz/}{R for Data Science} to learn about these packages.

The \texttt{tidyverse} ``umbrella'' package gets its name from the fact that all functions in all its constituent packages are designed to that all inputs/argument data frames are in ``tidy'' format and all output data frames are in ``tidy'' format as well. This standardization of input and output data frames makes transitions between the various functions in these packages as seamless as possible.

We'll now move to the ``data modeling'' portion in Chapters \ref{regression} and \ref{multiple-regression}, where you'll leverage your data visualization and wrangling skills to model relationships between different variables in data frames. However, we're going to leave the Chapter \ref{inference-for-regression} on ``Inference for Regression'' until after we've covered statistical inference.

\chapter{Basic Regression}\label{regression}}

Now that we are equipped with data visualization skills from Chapter \ref{viz}, an understanding of the ``tidy'' data format from Chapter \ref{tidy}, and data wrangling skills from Chapter \ref{wrangling}, we now proceed with data modeling. The fundamental premise of data modeling is \emph{to make explicit the relationship} between:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  an outcome variable \(y\), also called a dependent variable and
\item
  an explanatory/predictor variable \(x\), also called an independent variable or covariate.
\end{itemize}

Another way to state this is using mathematical terminology: we will model the outcome variable \(y\) \emph{as a function} of the explanatory/predictor variable \(x\). Why do we have two different labels, explanatory and predictor, for the variable \(x\)? That's because roughly speaking data modeling can be used for two purposes:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Modeling for prediction}: You want to predict an outcome variable \(y\) based on the information contained in a set of predictor variables. You don't care so much about understanding how all the variables relate and interact, but so long as you can make good predictions about \(y\), you're fine. For example, if we know many individuals' risk factors for lung cancer, such as smoking habits and age, can we predict whether or not they will develop lung cancer? Here we wouldn't care so much about distinguishing the degree to which the different risk factors contribute to lung cancer, but instead only on whether or not they could be put together to make reliable predictions.
\item
  \textbf{Modeling for explanation}: You want to explicitly describe the relationship between an outcome variable \(y\) and a set of explanatory variables, determine the significance of any found relationships, and have measures summarizing these. Continuing our example from above, we would now be interested in describing the individual effects of the different risk factors and quantifying the magnitude of these effects. One reason could be to design an intervention to reduce lung cancer cases in a population, such as targeting smokers of a specific age group with an advertisement for smoking cessation programs. In this book, we'll focus more on this latter purpose.
\end{enumerate}

Data modeling is used in a wide variety of fields, including statistical inference, causal inference, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. There are many techniques for data modeling, such as tree-based models, neural networks and deep learning, and supervised learning. In this chapter, we'll focus on one particular technique: \emph{linear regression}, one of the most commonly-used and easy-to-understand approaches to modeling. Recall our discussion in Subsection \ref{exploredataframes} on numerical and categorical variables. Linear regression involves:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  an outcome variable \(y\) that is \emph{numerical} and
\item
  explanatory variables \(\vec{x}\) that are either \emph{numerical} or \emph{categorical}.
\end{itemize}

With linear regression there is always only one numerical outcome variable \(y\) but we have choices on both the number and the type of explanatory variables \(\vec{x}\) to use. We're going to cover the following regression scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In this current chapter on basic regression, we'll always have only one explanatory variable.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In Section \ref{model1}, this explanatory variable will be a single numerical explanatory variable \(x\). This scenario is known as \emph{simple linear regression}.
  \item
    In Section \ref{model2}, this explanatory variable will be a categorical explanatory variable \(x\).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In the next chapter, Chapter \ref{multiple-regression} on \emph{multiple regression}, we'll have more than one explanatory variable:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We'll focus on two numerical explanatory variables \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) in Section \ref{model3}. This can be denoted as \(\vec{x}\) as well since we have more than one explanatory variable.
  \item
    We'll use one numerical and one categorical explanatory variable in Section \ref{model3}. We'll also introduce \emph{interaction models} here; there, the effect of one explanatory variable depends on the value of another.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

We'll study all four of these regression scenarios using real data, all easily accessible via R packages!

\hypertarget{needed-packages-3}{%
\subsection*{Needed packages}\label{needed-packages-3}}


In this chapter we introduce a new package, \texttt{moderndive}, that is an accompaniment package to this ModernDive book. It includes useful functions for linear regression and other functions as well as data used later in the book. Let's now load all the packages needed for this chapter. If needed, read Section \ref{packages} for information on how to install and load R packages.

\section{One numerical explanatory variable}\label{model1}}

Why do some professors and instructors at universities and colleges get high teaching evaluations from students while others don't? What factors can explain these differences? Are there biases? These are questions that are of interest to university/college administrators, as teaching evaluations are among the many criteria considered in determining which professors and instructors should get promotions. Researchers at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas (UT Austin) tried to answer this question: what factors can explain differences in instructor's teaching evaluation scores? To this end, they collected information on \(n = 463\) instructors. A full description of the study can be found at \href{https://www.openintro.org/stat/data/?data=evals}{openintro.org}.

We'll keep things simple for now and try to explain differences in instructor evaluation scores as a function of one numerical variable: their ``beauty score.'' The specifics on how this score was calculated will be described shortly.

Could it be that instructors with higher beauty scores also have higher teaching evaluations? Could it be instead that instructors with higher beauty scores tend to have lower teaching evaluations? Or could it be there is no relationship between beauty score and teaching evaluations?

We'll achieve ways to address these questions by modeling the relationship between these two variables with a particular kind of linear regression called \emph{simple linear regression}. Simple linear regression is the most basic form of linear regression. With it we have

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A numerical outcome variable \(y\). In this case, their teaching score.
\item
  A single numerical explanatory variable \(x\). In this case, their beauty score.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{model1EDA}{%
\subsection{Exploratory data analysis}\label{model1EDA}}

A crucial step before doing any kind of modeling or analysis is performing an \emph{exploratory data analysis}, or EDA, of all our data. Exploratory data analysis can give you a sense of the distribution of the data, and whether there are outliers and/or missing values. Most importantly, it can inform how to build your model. There are many approaches to exploratory data analysis; here are three:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Most fundamentally: just looking at the raw values, in a spreadsheet for example. While this may seem trivial, many people ignore this crucial step!
\item
  Computing summary statistics like means, medians, and standard deviations.
\item
  Creating data visualizations.
\end{enumerate}

Let's load the data, \texttt{select} only a subset of the variables, and look at the raw values. Recall you can look at the raw values by running \texttt{View()} in the console in RStudio to pop-up the spreadsheet viewer with the data frame of interest as the argument to \texttt{View()}. Here, however, we present only a snapshot of five randomly chosen rows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{evals_ch6 <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{evals }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(score, bty_avg, age)}

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{sample_n}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{table}[H]

\centering
\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont
\begin{tabular}{rrr}
\toprule
score & bty\_avg & age\\

3.6 & 6.67 & 34\\
4.9 & 3.50 & 43\\
3.3 & 2.33 & 47\\
4.4 & 4.67 & 33\\
4.7 & 3.67 & 60\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

While a full description of each of these variables can be found at \href{https://www.openintro.org/stat/data/?data=evals}{openintro.org}, let's summarize what each of these variables represents.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{score}: Numerical variable of the average teaching score based on students' evaluations between 1 and 5. This is the outcome variable \(y\) of interest.
\item
  \texttt{bty\_avg}: Numerical variable of average ``beauty'' rating based on a panel of 6 students' scores between 1 and 10. This is the numerical explanatory variable \(x\) of interest. Here 1 corresponds to a low beauty rating and 10 to a high beauty rating.
\item
  \texttt{age}: A numerical variable of age in years as an integer value.
\end{enumerate}

Another way to look at the raw values is using the \texttt{glimpse()} function, which gives us a slightly different view of the data. We see \texttt{Observations:\ 463}, indicating that there are 463 observations in \texttt{evals}, each corresponding to a particular instructor at UT Austin. Expressed differently, each row in the data frame \texttt{evals} corresponds to one of 463 instructors.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{glimpse}\NormalTok{(evals_ch6)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Observations: 463
Variables: 3
$ score   <dbl> 4.7, 4.1, 3.9, 4.8, 4.6, 4.3, 2.8, 4.1, 3.4,...
$ bty_avg <dbl> 5.00, 5.00, 5.00, 5.00, 3.00, 3.00, 3.00, 3....
$ age     <int> 36, 36, 36, 36, 59, 59, 59, 51, 51, 40, 40, ...
\end{verbatim}

Since both the outcome variable \texttt{score} and the explanatory variable \texttt{bty\_avg} are numerical, we can compute summary statistics about them such as the mean, median, and standard deviation. Let's take \texttt{evals\_ch6} and select only the two variables of interest for now. However, let's instead pipe this into the \texttt{skim()} function from the \texttt{skimr} package. This function quickly uses a ``skim'' of the data to return the following summary information about each variable.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{evals_ch6 }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(score, bty_avg) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{skim}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Skim summary statistics\\
n obs: 463\\
n variables: 2

Variable type: numeric

\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l}
\hline
variable & missing & complete & n & mean & sd & p0 & p25 & p50 & p75 & p100 & hist\\
\hline
bty\_avg & 0 & 463 & 463 & 4.42 & 1.53 & 1.67 & 3.17 & 4.33 & 5.5 & 8.17 & ▂▅▅▇▃▃▂▁\\

\hline
\end{tabular}

In this case for our two numerical variables \texttt{bty\_avg} beauty score and teaching score \texttt{score} it returns:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{missing}: the number of missing values
\item
  \texttt{complete}: the number of non-missing or complete values
\item
  \texttt{n}: the total number of values
\item
  \texttt{mean}: the average
\item
  \texttt{sd}: the standard deviation
\item
  \texttt{p0}: the 0\textsuperscript{th} percentile: the value at which 0\% of observations are smaller than it. This is also known as the \emph{minimum}
\item
  \texttt{p25}: the 25\textsuperscript{th} percentile: the value at which 25\% of observations are smaller than it. This is also known as the \emph{1\textsuperscript{st} quartile}
\item
  \texttt{p50}: the 50\textsuperscript{th} percentile: the value at which 50\% of observations are smaller than it. This is also know as the \emph{2\textsuperscript{nd}} quartile and more commonly the \emph{median}
\item
  \texttt{p75}: the 75\textsuperscript{th} percentile: the value at which 75\% of observations are smaller than it. This is also known as the \emph{3\textsuperscript{rd} quartile}
\item
  \texttt{p100}: the 100\textsuperscript{th} percentile: the value at which 100\% of observations are smaller than it. This is also known as the \emph{maximum}
\item
  A quick snapshot of the \texttt{hist}ogram
\end{itemize}

We get an idea of how the values in both variables are distributed. For example, the mean teaching score was 4.17 out of 5 whereas the mean beauty score was 4.42 out of 10. Furthermore, the middle 50\% of teaching scores were between 3.80 and 4.6 (the first and third quartiles) while the middle 50\% of beauty scores were between 3.17 and 5.5 out of 10.

The \texttt{skim()} function however only returns what are called \emph{univariate} summaries, i.e.~summaries about single variables at a time. Since we are considering the relationship between two numerical variables, it would be nice to have a summary statistic that simultaneously considers both variables. The \emph{correlation coefficient} is a \emph{bivariate} summary statistic that fits this bill. \emph{Coefficients} in general are quantitative expressions of a specific property of a phenomenon. A correlation coefficient is a quantitative expression between -1 and 1 that summarizes the \emph{strength of the linear relationship between two numerical variables}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  -1 indicates a perfect \emph{negative relationship}: as the value of one variable goes up, the value of the other variable tends to go down.
\item
  0 indicates no relationship: the values of both variables go up/down independently of each other.
\item
  +1 indicates a perfect \emph{positive relationship}: as the value of one variable goes up, the value of the other variable tends to go up as well.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:correlation1} gives examples of different correlation coefficient values for hypothetical numerical variables \(x\) and \(y\). We see that while for a correlation coefficient of -0.75 there is still a negative relationship between \(x\) and \(y\), it is not as strong as the negative relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) when the correlation coefficient is -1.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/correlation1-1} 

}

\caption{Different correlation coefficients}\label{fig:correlation1}
\end{figure}

The correlation coefficient is computed using the \texttt{get\_correlation()} function in the \texttt{moderndive} package, where in this case the inputs to the function are the two numerical variables from which we want to calculate the correlation coefficient. We place the name of the response variable on the left hand side of the \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} and the explanatory variable on the right hand side of the ``tilde.'' We will use this same ``formula'' syntax with regression later in this chapter.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{evals_ch6 }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{get_correlation}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{formula =}\NormalTok{ score }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{bty_avg)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  correlation
        <dbl>
1       0.187
\end{verbatim}

The correlation coefficient can also be computed using the \texttt{cor()} function, where in this case the inputs to the function are the two numerical variables from which we want to calculate the correlation coefficient. Recall from Subsection \ref{exploredataframes} that the \texttt{\$} pulls out specific variables from a data frame:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{cor}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ evals_ch6}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{bty_avg, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ evals_ch6}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{score)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 0.187
\end{verbatim}

In our case, the correlation coefficient of 0.187 indicates that the relationship between teaching evaluation score and beauty average is ``weakly positive.'' There is a certain amount of subjectivity in interpreting correlation coefficients, especially those that aren't close to -1, 0, and 1. For help developing such intuition and more discussion on the correlation coefficient see Subsection \ref{correlationcoefficient} below.

Let's now proceed by visualizing this data. Since both the \texttt{score} and \texttt{bty\_avg} variables are numerical, a scatterplot is an appropriate graph to visualize this data. Let's do this using \texttt{geom\_point()} and set informative axes labels and title and display the result in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot1}.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/numxplot1-1} 

}

\caption{Instructor evaluation scores at UT Austin}\label{fig:numxplot1}
\end{figure}

Observe the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Most ``beauty'' scores lie between 2 and 8.
\item
  Most teaching scores lie between 3 and 5.
\item
  Recall our earlier computation of the correlation coefficient, which describes the strength of the linear relationship between two numerical variables. Looking at Figure \ref{fig:numxplot2}, it is not immediately apparent that these two variables are positively related. This is to be expected given the positive, but rather weak (close to 0), correlation coefficient of 0.187.
\end{enumerate}

Before we continue, we bring to light an important fact about this dataset: it suffers from \emph{overplotting}. Recall from the data visualization Subsection \ref{overplotting} that overplotting occurs when several points are stacked directly on top of each other thereby obscuring the number of points. For example, let's focus on the 6 points in the top-right of the plot with a beauty score of around 8 out of 10: are there truly only 6 points, or are there many more just stacked on top of each other? You can think of these as \emph{ties}. Let's break up these ties with a little random ``jitter'' added to the points in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot2}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/numxplot2-1} 

}

\caption{Instructor evaluation scores at UT Austin: Jittered}\label{fig:numxplot2}
\end{figure}

Jittering adds a little random bump to each of the points to break up these ties: just enough so you can distinguish them, but not so much that the plot is overly altered. Furthermore, jittering is strictly a visualization tool; it does not alter the original values in the dataset.

Let's compare side-by-side the regular scatterplot in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot1} with the jittered scatterplot in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot2} in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot2-a}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/numxplot2-a-1} 

}

\caption{Comparing regular and jittered scatterplots.}\label{fig:numxplot2-a}
\end{figure}

We make several further observations:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Focusing our attention on the top-right of the plot again, as noted earlier where there seemed to only be 6 points in the regular scatterplot, we see there were in fact really 9 as seen in the jittered scatterplot.
\item
  A further interesting trend is that the jittering revealed a large number of instructors with beauty scores of between 3 and 4.5, towards the lower end of the beauty scale.
\end{enumerate}

To keep things simple in this chapter, we'll present regular scatterplots rather than the jittered scatterplots, though we'll keep the overplotting in mind whenever looking at such plots. Going back to scatterplot in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot1}, let's improve on it by adding a ``regression line'' in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot3}. This is easily done by adding a new layer to the \texttt{ggplot} code that created Figure \ref{fig:numxplot2}: \texttt{+\ geom\_smooth(method\ =\ "lm")}. A regression line is a ``best fitting'' line in that of all possible lines you could draw on this plot, it is ``best'' in terms of some mathematical criteria. We discuss the criteria for ``best'' in Subsection \ref{leastsquares} below, but we suggest you read this only after covering the concept of a \emph{residual} coming up in Subsection \ref{model1points}.

\end{figure}

When viewed on this plot, the regression line is a visual summary of the relationship between two numerical variables, in our case the outcome variable \texttt{score} and the explanatory variable \texttt{bty\_avg}. The positive slope of the blue line is consistent with our observed correlation coefficient of 0.187 suggesting that there is a positive relationship between \texttt{score} and \texttt{bty\_avg}. We'll see later however that while the correlation coefficient is not equal to the slope of this line, they always have the same sign: positive or negative.

What are the grey bands surrounding the blue line? These are \emph{standard error} bands, which can be thought of as error/uncertainty bands. Let's skip this idea for now and suppress these grey bars by adding the argument \texttt{se\ =\ FALSE} to \texttt{geom\_smooth(method\ =\ "lm")}. We'll introduce standard errors in Chapter \ref{sampling} on sampling, use them for constructing \emph{confidence intervals} and conducting \emph{hypothesis tests} in Chapters \ref{confidence-intervals} and \ref{hypothesis-testing}, and consider them when we revisit regression in Chapter \ref{inference-for-regression}.

\textbf{(LC6.1)} Conduct a new exploratory data analysis with the same outcome variable \(y\) being \texttt{score} but with \texttt{age} as the new explanatory variable \(x\). Remember, this involves three things:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Looking at the raw values.
\item
  Computing summary statistics of the variables of interest.
\item

What can you say about the relationship between age and teaching scores based on this exploration?

\begin{learncheck}

\hypertarget{model1table}{%
\subsection{Simple linear regression}\label{model1table}}

You may recall from secondary school / high school algebra, in general, the equation of a line is \(y = a + bx\), which is defined by two coefficients. Recall we defined this earlier as ``quantitative expressions of a specific property of a phenomenon.'' These two coefficients are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the intercept coefficient \(a\), or the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\), and
\item
  the slope coefficient \(b\), or the increase in \(y\) for every increase of one in \(x\).
\end{itemize}

However, when defining a line specifically for regression, like the blue regression line in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot4}, we use slightly different notation: the equation of the regression line is \(\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \cdot x\) where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the intercept coefficient is \(b_0\), or the value of \(\widehat{y}\) when \(x=0\), and
\item
  the slope coefficient \(b_1\), or the increase in \(\widehat{y}\) for every increase of one in \(x\).
\end{itemize}

Why do we put a ``hat'' on top of the \(y\)? It's a form of notation commonly used in regression, which we'll introduce in the next Subsection \ref{model1points} when we discuss \emph{fitted values}. For now, let's ignore the hat and treat the equation of the line as you would from secondary school / high school algebra recognizing the slope and the intercept. We know looking at Figure \ref{fig:numxplot4} that the slope coefficient corresponding to \texttt{bty\_avg} should be positive. Why? Because as \texttt{bty\_avg} increases, professors tend to roughly have larger teaching evaluation \texttt{scores}. However, what are the specific values of the intercept and slope coefficients? Let's not worry about computing these by hand, but instead let the computer do the work for us. Specifically let's use R!

Let's get the value of the intercept and slope coefficients by outputting something called the \emph{linear regression table}. We will fit the linear regression model to the \texttt{data} using the \texttt{lm()} function and save this to \texttt{score\_model}. \texttt{lm} stands for ``linear model'', given that we are dealing with lines. When we say ``fit'', we are saying find the best fitting line to this data.

The \texttt{lm()} function that ``fits'' the linear regression model is typically used as \texttt{lm(y\ \textasciitilde{}\ x,\ data\ =\ data\_frame\_name)} where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{y} is the outcome variable, followed by a tilde (\texttt{\textasciitilde{}}). This is likely the key to the left of ``1'' on your keyboard. In our case, \texttt{y} is set to \texttt{score}.
\item
  \texttt{x} is the explanatory variable. In our case, \texttt{x} is set to \texttt{bty\_avg}. We call the combination \texttt{y\ \textasciitilde{}\ x} a \emph{model formula}. Recall the use of this notation when we computed the correlation coefficient using the \texttt{get\_correlation()} function in Subsection \ref{model1EDA}.
\item
  \texttt{data\_frame\_name} is the name of the data frame that contains the variables \texttt{y} and \texttt{x}. In our case, \texttt{data\_frame\_name} is the \texttt{evals\_ch6} data frame.
\end{itemize}

Coefficients:

\end{verbatim}

This output is telling us that the \texttt{Intercept} coefficient \(b_0\) of the regression line is 3.8803 and the slope coefficient for \texttt{by\_avg} is 0.0666. Therefore the blue regression line in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot4} is

\[\widehat{\text{score}} = b_0 + b_{\text{bty avg}} \cdot\text{bty avg} = 3.8803 + 0.0666\cdot\text{ bty avg}\]

where

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The intercept coefficient \(b_0 = 3.8803\) means for instructors that had a hypothetical beauty score of 0, we would expect them to have on average a teaching score of 3.8803. In this case however, while the intercept has a mathematical interpretation when defining the regression line, there is no \emph{practical} interpretation since \texttt{score} is an average of a panel of 6 students' ratings from 1 to 10, a \texttt{bty\_avg} of 0 would be impossible. Furthermore, no instructors had a beauty score anywhere near 0 in this data.
\item
  Of more interest is the slope coefficient associated with \texttt{bty\_avg}: \(b_{\text{bty avg}} = +0.0666\). This is a numerical quantity that summarizes the relationship between the outcome and explanatory variables. Note that the sign is positive, suggesting a positive relationship between beauty scores and teaching scores, meaning as beauty scores go up, so also do teaching scores go up. The slope's precise interpretation is:

  \begin{quote}
  For every increase of 1 unit in \texttt{bty\_avg}, there is an \emph{associated} increase of, \emph{on average}, 0.0666 units of \texttt{score}.
  \end{quote}
\end{itemize}

Such interpretations need be carefully worded:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We only stated that there is an \emph{associated} increase, and not necessarily a \emph{causal} increase. For example, perhaps it's not that beauty directly affects teaching scores, but instead individuals from wealthier backgrounds tend to have had better education and training, and hence have higher teaching scores, but these same individuals also have higher beauty scores. Avoiding such reasoning can be summarized by the adage ``correlation is not necessarily causation.'' In other words, just because two variables are correlated, it doesn't mean one directly causes the other. We discuss these ideas more in Subsection \ref{correlation-is-not-causation}.\\
\item
  We say that this associated increase is \emph{on average} 0.0666 units of teaching \texttt{score} and not that the associated increase is \emph{exactly} 0.0666 units of \texttt{score} across all values of \texttt{bty\_avg}. This is because the slope is the average increase across all points as shown by the regression line in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot4}.
\end{itemize}

Now that we've learned how to compute the equation for the blue regression line in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot4} and interpreted all its terms, let's take our modeling one step further. This time after fitting the model using the \texttt{lm()}, let's get something called the \emph{regression table} using the \texttt{get\_regression\_table()} function from the \texttt{moderndive} package:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\CommentTok{# Get regression table:}
\KeywordTok{get_regression_table}\NormalTok{(score_model)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:numxplot4b}Linear regression table}
\centering
\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrr}
\toprule

\midrule
intercept & 3.880 & 0.076 & 50.96 & 0 & 3.731 & 4.030\\
bty\_avg & 0.067 & 0.016 & 4.09 & 0 & 0.035 & 0.099\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Note how we took the output of the model fit saved in \texttt{score\_model} and used it as an input to the subsequent \texttt{get\_regression\_table()} function. The output now looks like a table: in fact it is a data frame. The values of the intercept and slope of 3.880 and 0.0666 are now in the \texttt{estimate} column. But what are the remaining 5 columns: \texttt{std\_error}, \texttt{statistic}, \texttt{p\_value}, \texttt{lower\_ci} and \texttt{upper\_ci}? What do they tell us? They tell us about both the \emph{statistical significance} and \emph{practical significance} of our model results. You can think of this loosely as the ``meaningfulness'' of the results from a statistical perspective.

We are going to put aside these ideas for now and revisit them in Chapter \ref{inference-for-regression} on (statistical) inference for regression, after we've had a chance to cover:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Standard errors in Chapter \ref{sampling} (\texttt{std\_error})
\item
  Confidence intervals in Chapter \ref{confidence-intervals} (\texttt{lower\_ci} and \texttt{upper\_ci})
\item
  Hypothesis testing in Chapter \ref{hypothesis-testing} (\texttt{statistic} and \texttt{p\_value}).
\end{itemize}

For now, we'll only focus on the \texttt{term} and \texttt{estimate} columns of any regression table.

The \texttt{get\_regression\_table()} from the \texttt{moderndive} is an example of what's known as a \emph{wrapper function} in computer programming, which takes other pre-existing functions and ``wraps'' them into a single function. This concept is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:moderndive-figure-wrapper}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/flowcharts/flowchart.011-cropped} 

}

\caption{The concept of a 'wrapper' function.}\label{fig:moderndive-figure-wrapper}
\end{figure}

So all you need to worry about is the what the inputs look like and what the outputs look like; you leave all the other details ``under the hood of the car.'' In our regression modeling example, the \texttt{get\_regression\_table()} has

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Input: A saved \texttt{lm()} linear regression
\item
  Output: A data frame with information on the intercept and slope of the regression line.
\end{itemize}

If you're interested in learning more about the \texttt{get\_regression\_table()} function's construction and thinking, see Subsection \ref{underthehood} below.

\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC6.2)} Fit a new simple linear regression using \texttt{lm(score\ \textasciitilde{}\ age,\ data\ =\ evals\_ch6)} where \texttt{age} is the new explanatory variable \(x\). Get information about the ``best-fitting'' line from the regression table by applying the \texttt{get\_regression\_table()} function. How do the regression results match up with the results from your exploratory data analysis above?

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

\hypertarget{model1points}{%
\subsection{Observed/fitted values and residuals}\label{model1points}}

We just saw how to get the value of the intercept and the slope of the regression line from the regression table generated by \texttt{get\_regression\_table()}. Now instead, say we want information on individual points. In this case, we focus on one of the \(n = 463\) instructors in this dataset, corresponding to a single row of \texttt{evals\_ch6}.

For example, say we are interested in the 21st instructor in this dataset:

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-161}Data for 21st instructor}
\centering
\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont
\begin{tabular}{rrr}
\toprule
score & bty\_avg & age\\
\midrule
4.9 & 7.33 & 31\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

What is the value on the blue line corresponding to this instructor's \texttt{bty\_avg} of 7.333? In Figure \ref{fig:numxplot5} we mark three values in particular corresponding to this instructor.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Red circle: This is the \emph{observed value} \(y\) = 4.9 and corresponds to this instructor's actual teaching score.
\item
  Red square: This is the \emph{fitted value} \(\widehat{y}\) and corresponds to the value on the regression line for \(x\) = 7.333. This value is computed using the intercept and slope in the regression table above: \[\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \cdot x = 3.88 + 0.067 * 7.333 = 4.369\]
\item
  Blue arrow: The length of this arrow is the \emph{residual} and is computed by subtracting the fitted value \(\widehat{y}\) from the observed value \(y\). The residual can be thought of as the error or ``lack of fit'' of the regression line. In the case of this instructor, it is \(y - \widehat{y}\) = 4.9 - 4.369 = 0.531. In other words, the model was off by 0.531 teaching score units for this instructor.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/numxplot5-1} 

}

\caption{Example of observed value, fitted value, and residual}\label{fig:numxplot5}
\end{figure}

What if we want both

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the fitted value \(\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \cdot x\) and
\item
  the residual \(y - \widehat{y}\)
\end{enumerate}

not only the 21st instructor but for all 463 instructors in the study? Recall that each instructor corresponds to one of the 463 rows in the \texttt{evals\_ch6} data frame and also one of the 463 points in the regression plot in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot4}.

We could repeat the above calculations by hand 463 times, but that would be tedious and time consuming. Instead, let's use the \texttt{get\_regression\_points()} function that we've included in the \texttt{moderndive} R package. Note that in the table below we only present the results for the 21st through the 24th instructors.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

21 & 4.9 & 7.33 & 4.37 & 0.531\\

24 & 4.4 & 5.50 & 4.25 & 0.153\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Just as with the \texttt{get\_regression\_table()} function, the inputs to the \texttt{get\_regression\_points()} function are the same, however the outputs are different. Let's inspect the individual columns:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \texttt{score} column represents the observed value of the outcome variable \(y\).
\item
  The \texttt{bty\_avg} column represents the values of the explanatory variable \(x\).
\item
  The \texttt{score\_hat} column represents the fitted values \(\widehat{y}\).
\item
  The \texttt{residual} column represents the residuals \(y - \widehat{y}\).
\end{itemize}

\texttt{get\_regression\_points()} is another example of a wrapper function we described in Figure \ref{fig:moderndive-figure-wrapper}. If you're curious about this function as well, check out Subsection \ref{underthehood}.

Just as we did for the 21st instructor in the \texttt{evals\_ch6} dataset (in the first row of the table above), let's repeat the above calculations for the 24th instructor in the \texttt{evals\_ch6} dataset (in the fourth row of the table above):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{score} = 4.4 is the observed value \(y\) for this instructor.
\item
  \texttt{bty\_avg} = 5.50 is the value of the explanatory variable \(x\) for this instructor.
\item
  \texttt{score\_hat} = 4.25 = 3.88 + 0.067 * \(x\) = 3.88 + 0.067 * 5.50 is the fitted value \(\widehat{y}\) for this instructor.
\item
  \texttt{residual} = 0.153 = 4.4 - 4.25 is the value of the residual for this instructor. In other words, the model was off by 0.153 teaching score units for this instructor.
\end{itemize}

More development of this idea appears in Section \ref{leastsquares} and we encourage you to read that section after you investigate residuals.

\hypertarget{model2}{%
\section{One categorical explanatory variable}\label{model2}}

It's an unfortunate truth that life expectancy is not the same across various countries in the world; there are a multitude of factors that are associated with how long people live. International development agencies are very interested in studying these differences in the hope of understanding where governments should allocate resources to address this problem. In this section, we'll explore differences in life expectancy in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Differences between continents: Are there significant differences in life expectancy, on average, between the five continents of the world: Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania?
\item
  Differences within continents: How does life expectancy vary within the world's five continents? For example, is the spread of life expectancy among the countries of Africa larger than the spread of life expectancy among the countries of Asia?
\end{enumerate}

To answer such questions, we'll study the \texttt{gapminder} dataset in the \texttt{gapminder} package. Recall we mentioned this dataset in Subsection \ref{gapminder} when we first studied the ``Grammar of Graphics'' introduced in Figure \ref{fig:gapminder}. This dataset has international development statistics such as life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population by country (\(n\) = 142) for 5-year intervals between 1952 and 2007.

We'll use this data for linear regression again, but note that our explanatory variable \(x\) is now categorical, and not numerical like when we covered simple linear regression in Section \ref{model1}. More precisely, we have:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A numerical outcome variable \(y\). In this case, life expectancy.
\item
  A single categorical explanatory variable \(x\), In this case, the continent the country is part of.
\end{enumerate}

When the explanatory variable \(x\) is categorical, the concept of a ``best-fitting'' line is a little different than the one we saw previously in Section \ref{model1} where the explanatory variable \(x\) was numerical. We'll study these differences shortly in Subsection \ref{model2table}, but first we conduct our exploratory data analysis.

\hypertarget{model2EDA}{%
\subsection{Exploratory data analysis}\label{model2EDA}}

Let's load the \texttt{gapminder} data and \texttt{filter()} for only observations in 2007. Next we \texttt{select()} only the variables we'll need along with \texttt{gdpPercap}, which is each country's gross domestic product per capita (GDP). GDP is a rough measure of that country's economic performance. (This will be used for the upcoming Learning Check). Lastly, we save this in a data frame with name \texttt{gapminder2007}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You should look at the raw data values both by bringing up RStudio's spreadsheet viewer and the \texttt{glimpse()} function. In Table \ref{tab:model2-data-preview} we only show 5 randomly selected countries out of 142:

We see that the variable \texttt{continent} is indeed categorical, as it is encoded as \texttt{fct} which stands for ``factor.'' This is R's way of storing categorical variables. Let's once again apply the \texttt{skim()} function from the \texttt{skimr} package to our two variables of interest: \texttt{continent} and \texttt{lifeExp}:

\end{verbatim}

The output now reports summaries for categorical variables (the variable type: factor) separately from the numerical variables. For the categorical variable \texttt{continent} it now reports:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{missing}, \texttt{complete}, \texttt{n} as before which are the number of missing, complete, and total number of values.
\item
  \texttt{n\_unique}: The unique number of levels to this variable, corresponding to Africa, Asia, Americas, Europe, and Oceania
\item
  \texttt{top\_counts}: In this case the top four counts: Africa has 52 entries each corresponding to a country, Asia has 33, Europe has 30, and Americans has 25. Not displayed is Oceania with 2 countries
\item
  \texttt{ordered}: Reporting whether the variable is ``ordinal.'' In this case, it is not ordered.
\end{itemize}

Given that the global median life expectancy is 71.94, half of the world's countries (71 countries) will have a life expectancy less than 71.94. Further, half will have a life expectancy greater than this value. The mean life expectancy of 67.01 is lower however. Why are these two values different? Let's look at a histogram of \texttt{lifeExp} in Figure \ref{fig:lifeExp2007hist} to see why.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/lifeExp2007hist-1} 

}

\caption{Histogram of Life Expectancy in 2007}\label{fig:lifeExp2007hist}
\end{figure}

We see that this data is left-skewed/negatively skewed: there are a few countries with very low life expectancy that are bringing down the mean life expectancy. However, the median is less sensitive to the effects of such outliers. Hence the median is greater than the mean in this case. Let's proceed by comparing median and mean life expectancy between continents by adding a \texttt{group\_by(continent)} to the above code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{lifeExp_by_continent <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{gapminder2007 }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(continent) }\OperatorTok{%>%}

\begin{tabular}{lrr}

Africa & 52.9 & 54.8\\
Americas & 72.9 & 73.6\\

Europe & 78.6 & 77.6\\
Oceania & 80.7 & 80.7\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We see now that there are differences in life expectancy between the continents. For example let's focus on only medians. While the median life expectancy across all \(n = 142\) countries in 2007 was 71.935, the median life expectancy across the \(n =52\) countries in Africa was only 52.927.

Let's create a corresponding visualization. One way to compare the life expectancy of countries in different continents would be via a faceted histogram. Recall we saw back in the Data Visualization chapter, specifically Section \ref{facets}, that facets allow us to split a visualization by the different levels of a categorical variable or factor variable. In Figure \ref{fig:catxplot0b}, the variable we facet by is \texttt{continent}, which is categorical with five levels, each corresponding to the five continents of the world.

\caption{Life expectancy in 2007}\label{fig:catxplot0b}
\end{figure}

Another way would be via a \texttt{geom\_boxplot} where we map the categorical variable \texttt{continent} to the \(x\)-axis and the different life expectancy within each continent on the \(y\)-axis; we do this in Figure \ref{fig:catxplot1}.

\begin{Shaded}

\caption{Life expectancy in 2007}\label{fig:catxplot1}
\end{figure}

Some people prefer comparing a numerical variable between different levels of a categorical variable, in this case comparing life expectancy between different continents, using a boxplot over a faceted histogram as we can make quick comparisons with single horizontal lines. For example, we can see that even the country with the highest life expectancy in Africa is still lower than all countries in Oceania.

It's important to remember however that the solid lines in the middle of the boxes correspond to the medians (i.e.~the middle value) rather than the mean (the average). So, for example, if you look at Asia, the solid line denotes the median life expectancy of around 72 years, indicating to us that half of all countries in Asia have a life expectancy below 72 years whereas half of all countries in Asia have a life expectancy above 72 years. Furthermore, note that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Africa and Asia have much more spread/variation in life expectancy as indicated by the interquartile range (the height of the boxes).
\item
  Oceania has almost no spread/variation, but this might in large part be due to the fact there are only two countries in Oceania: Australia and New Zealand.
\end{itemize}

Now, let's start making comparisons of life expectancy \emph{between} continents. Let's use Africa as a \emph{baseline for comparison}. Why Africa? Only because it happened to be first alphabetically, we could have just as appropriately used the Americas as the baseline for comparison. Using the ``eyeball test'' (just using our eyes to see if anything stands out), we make the following observations about differences in median life expectancy compared to the baseline of Africa:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The median life expectancy of the Americas is roughly 20 years greater.
\item
  The median life expectancy of Asia is roughly 20 years greater.
\item
  The median life expectancy of Europe is roughly 25 years greater.
\item
  The median life expectancy of Oceania is roughly 27.8 years greater.
\end{enumerate}

Let's remember these four differences vs Africa corresponding to the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania: 20, 20, 25, 27.8.

\tightlist

\hypertarget{model2table}{%
\subsection{Linear regression}\label{model2table}}

In Subsection \ref{model1table} we introduced \emph{simple} linear regression, which involves modeling the relationship between a numerical outcome variable \(y\) as a function of a numerical explanatory variable \(x\), in our life expectancy example, we now have a categorical explanatory variable \(x\) \texttt{continent}. While we still can fit a regression model, given our categorical explanatory variable we no longer have a concept of a ``best-fitting'' line, but rather ``differences relative to a baseline for comparison.''

Before we fit our regression model, let's create a table similar to Table \ref{tab:catxplot0}, but

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Report the mean life expectancy for each continent.
\item
  Report the difference in mean life expectancy \emph{relative} to Africa's mean life expectancy of 54.806 in the column ``mean vs Africa''; this column is simply the ``mean'' column minus 54.806.
\end{enumerate}

Think back to your observations from the eyeball test of Figure \ref{fig:catxplot1} at the end of the last subsection. The column ``mean vs Africa'' is the same idea of comparing a summary statistic to a baseline for comparison, in this case the countries of Africa, but using means instead of medians.

\begin{table}[H]

Now, let's use the \texttt{get\_regression\_table()} function we introduced in Section \ref{model1table} to get the \emph{regression table} for \texttt{gapminder2007} analysis:

continentOceania & 25.9 & 5.33 & 4.86 & 0 & 15.4 & 36.5\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Just as before, we have the \texttt{term} and \texttt{estimates} columns of interest, but unlike before, we now have 5 rows corresponding to 5 outputs in our table: an intercept like before, but also \texttt{continentAmericas}, \texttt{continentAsia}, \texttt{continentEurope}, and \texttt{continentOceania}. What are these values? First, we must describe the equation for fitted value \(\widehat{y}\), which is a little more complicated when the \(x\) explanatory variable is categorical:

\begin{align}
\widehat{\text{life exp}} &= b_0 + b_{\text{Amer}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Amer}}(x) + b_{\text{Asia}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Asia}}(x)
+ b_{\text{Euro}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Euro}}(x) + b_{\text{Ocean}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Ocean}}(x)\\
&= 54.8 + 18.8\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Amer}}(x) + 15.9\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Asia}}(x)
+ 22.8\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Euro}}(x) + 25.9\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Ocean}}(x)
\end{align}

Let's break this down. First, \(\mathbb{1}_{A}(x)\) is what's known in mathematics as an ``indicator function'' that takes one of two possible values:

\[
\mathbb{1}_{A}(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \text{if } x \text{ is in } A \\
0 & \text{if } \text{otherwise} \end{array}
\right.
\]

In a statistical modeling context this is also known as a ``dummy variable''. In our case, let's consider the first such indicator variable:

\[
\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Amer}}(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \text{if } \text{country } x \text{ is in the Americas} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}\end{array}
\right.
\]

Now let's interpret the terms in the estimate column of the regression table. First \(b_0 =\) \texttt{intercept\ =\ 54.8} corresponds to the mean life expectancy for countries in Africa, since for country \(x\) in Africa we have the following equation:

\begin{align}
\widehat{\text{life exp}} &= b_0 + b_{\text{Amer}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Amer}}(x) + b_{\text{Asia}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Asia}}(x)
+ b_{\text{Euro}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Euro}}(x) + b_{\text{Ocean}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Ocean}}(x)\\
&= 54.8 + 18.8\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Amer}}(x) + 15.9\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Asia}}(x)
+ 22.8\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Euro}}(x) + 25.9\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Ocean}}(x)\\
&= 54.8 + 18.8\cdot 0 + 15.9\cdot 0 + 22.8\cdot 0 + 25.9\cdot 0\\
&= 54.8
\end{align}

i.e.~All four of the indicator variables are equal to 0. Recall we stated earlier that we would treat Africa as the baseline for comparison group. Furthermore, this value corresponds to the group mean life expectancy for all African countries in Table \ref{tab:continent-mean-life-expectancies}.

Next, \(b_{\text{Amer}}\) = \texttt{continentAmericas\ =\ 18.8} is the difference in mean life expectancy of countries in the Americas relative to Africa, or in other words, on average countries in the Americas had life expectancy 18.8 years greater. The fitted value yielded by this equation is:

\begin{align}
\widehat{\text{life exp}} &= b_0 + b_{\text{Amer}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Amer}}(x) + b_{\text{Asia}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Asia}}(x)
+ b_{\text{Euro}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Euro}}(x) + b_{\text{Ocean}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Ocean}}(x)\\
&= 54.8 + 18.8\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Amer}}(x) + 15.9\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Asia}}(x)
+ 22.8\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Euro}}(x) + 25.9\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Ocean}}(x)\\
&= 54.8 + 18.8\cdot 1 + 15.9\cdot 0 + 22.8\cdot 0 + 25.9\cdot 0\\
&= 54.8 + 18.8\\
&= 72.9
\end{align}

i.e.~in this case, only the indicator function \(\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Amer}}(x)\) is equal to 1, but all others are 0. Recall that 72.9 corresponds to the group mean life expectancy for all countries in the Americas in Table \ref{tab:continent-mean-life-expectancies}.

Similarly, \(b_{\text{Asia}}\) = \texttt{continentAsia\ =\ 15.9} is the difference in mean life expectancy of Asian countries relative to Africa countries, or in other words, on average countries in the Asia had life expectancy 18.8 years greater than Africa. The fitted value yielded by this equation is:

\begin{align}
\widehat{\text{life exp}} &= b_0 + b_{\text{Amer}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Amer}}(x) + b_{\text{Asia}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Asia}}(x)
+ b_{\text{Euro}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Euro}}(x) + b_{\text{Ocean}}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Ocean}}(x)\\
&= 54.8 + 18.8\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Amer}}(x) + 15.9\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Asia}}(x)
+ 22.8\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Euro}}(x) + 25.9\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Ocean}}(x)\\
&= 54.8 + 18.8\cdot 0 + 15.9\cdot 1 + 22.8\cdot 0 + 25.9\cdot 0\\
&= 54.8 + 15.9\\
&= 70.7
\end{align}

i.e.~in this case, only the indicator function \(\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{Asia}}(x)\) is equal to 1, but all others are 0. Recall that 70.7 corresponds to the group mean life expectancy for all countries in Asia in Table \ref{tab:continent-mean-life-expectancies}. The same logic applies to \(b_{\text{Euro}} = 22.8\) and \(b_{\text{Ocean}} = 25.9\); they correspond to the ``offset'' in mean life expectancy for countries in Europe and Oceania, relative to the mean life expectancy of the baseline group for comparison of African countries.

Let's generalize this idea a bit. If we fit a linear regression model using a categorical explanatory variable \(x\) that has \(k\) levels, a regression model will return an intercept and \(k - 1\) ``slope'' coefficients. When \(x\) is a numerical explanatory variable the interpretation is of a ``slope'' coefficient, but when \(x\) is categorical the meaning is a little trickier. They are \emph{offsets} relative to the baseline.

In our case, since there are \(k = 5\) continents, the regression model returns an intercept corresponding to the baseline for comparison Africa and \(k - 1 = 4\) slope coefficients corresponding to the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Africa was chosen as the baseline by R for no other reason than it is first alphabetically of the 5 continents. You can manually specify which continent to use as baseline instead of the default choice of whichever comes first alphabetically, but we leave that to a more advanced course. (The \texttt{forcats} package is particularly nice for doing this and we encourage you to explore using it.)

\end{enumerate}

What do fitted values \(\widehat{y}\) and residuals \(y - \widehat{y}\) correspond to when the explanatory variable \(x\) is categorical? Let's investigate these values for the first 10 countries in the \texttt{gapminder2007} dataset:

Notice

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The fitted values \texttt{lifeExp\_hat} \(\widehat{\text{lifeexp}}\). Countries in Africa have the
  same fitted value of 54.8, which is the mean life expectancy of Africa. Countries in Asia have the same fitted value of 70.7, which is the mean life
  expectancy of Asia. This similarly holds for countries in the Americas, Europe,
  and Oceania.
\item
  The \texttt{residual} column is simply \(y - \widehat{y}\) = \texttt{lifeexp\ -\ lifeexp\_hat}.
  These values can be interpreted as that particular country's deviation from the
  mean life expectancy of the respective continent's mean. For example, the first
  row of this dataset corresponds to Afghanistan, and the residual of
  \(-26.9 = 43.8 - 70.7\) is Afghanistan's mean life expectancy minus the mean life
  expectancy of all Asian countries.

Let's re-plot Figure \ref{fig:correlation1}, but now consider a broader range of correlation coefficient values in Figure \ref{fig:correlation2}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/correlation2-1}

\caption{Different Correlation Coefficients}\label{fig:correlation2}
\end{figure}

As we suggested in Subsection \ref{model1EDA}, interpreting coefficients that are not close to the extreme values of -1 and 1 can be subjective. To develop your sense of correlation coefficients, we suggest you play the following 80's-style video game called ``Guess the correlation''! Click on the image below to do so:

\hypertarget{correlation-is-not-causation}{%
\subsection{Correlation is not necessarily causation}\label{correlation-is-not-causation}}

You'll note throughout this chapter we've been very cautious in making statements of the ``associated effect'' of explanatory variables on the outcome variables, for example our statement from Subsection \ref{model1table} that ``for every increase of 1 unit in \texttt{bty\_avg}, there is an \emph{associated} increase of, \emph{on average}, 18.802 units of \texttt{score}.'' We stay this because we are careful not to make \emph{causal} statements. So while beauty score \texttt{bty\_avg} is positively correlated with teaching \texttt{score}, does it directly cause effects on teaching score.

For example, let's say an instructor has their \texttt{bty\_avg} reevaluated, but only after taking steps to try to boost their beauty score. Does this mean that they will suddenly be a better instructor? Or will they suddenly get higher teaching scores? Maybe?

Here is another example, a not-so-great medical doctor goes through their medical records and finds that patients who slept with their shoes on tended to wake up more with headaches. So this doctor declares ``Sleeping with shoes on cause headaches!''

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/flowcharts/flowchart.010-cropped} 

}

\caption{Does sleeping with shoes on cause headaches?}\label{fig:moderndive-figure-causal-graph-2}
\end{figure}

However as some of you might have guessed, if someone is sleeping with their shoes on its probably because they are intoxicated. Furthermore, drinking more tends to cause more hangovers, and hence more headaches.

In this instance, alcohol is what's known as a \emph{confounding/lurking} variable. It ``lurks'' behind the scenes, confounding or making less apparent, the causal effect (if any) of ``sleeping with shoes on'' with waking up with a headache. We can summarize this notion in Figure \ref{fig:moderndive-figure-causal-graph} with a \emph{causal graph} where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Y: Is an \emph{outcome} variable, here ``waking up with a headache.''
\item
  X: Is a \emph{treatment} variable whose causal effect we are interested in, here ``sleeping with shoes on.''
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/flowcharts/flowchart.009-cropped} 

}

\caption{Causal graph.}\label{fig:moderndive-figure-causal-graph}
\end{figure}

So for example, many such studies use regression modeling where the outcome variable is set to Y and the explanatory/predictor variable is X, much as you've started learning how to do in this chapter. However, Figure \ref{fig:moderndive-figure-causal-graph} also includes a third variable with arrows pointing at both X and Y.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Z: Is a \emph{confounding} variable that affects both X \& Y, thus ``confounding'' their relationship.
\end{itemize}

So as we said, alcohol will both cause people to be more likely to sleep with their shoes on as well as more likely to wake up with a headache. Thus when evaluating what causes one to wake up with a headache, its hard to tease out the effect of sleeping with shoes on versus just the alcohol. Thus our model needs to also use Z as an explanatory/predictor variable as well, in other words our doctor needs to take into account who had been drinking the night before. We'll start covering multiple regression models that allows us to incorporate more than one variable in the next chapter.

Establishing causation is a tricky problem and frequently takes either carefully designed experiments or methods to control for the effects of potential confounding variables. Both these approaches attempt either to remove all confounding variables or take them into account as best they can, and only focus on the behavior of an outcome variable in the presence of the levels of the other variable(s). Be careful as you read studies to make sure that the writers aren't falling into this fallacy of correlation implying causation. If you spot one, you may want to send them a link to \href{http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations}{Spurious Correlations}.

\hypertarget{leastsquares}{%
\subsection{Best fitting line}\label{leastsquares}}

Regression lines are also known as ``best fitting lines''. But what do we mean by best? Let's unpack the criteria
that is used by regression to determine best. Recall the plot in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot5} where for a instructor
with a beauty average score of \(x=7.333\)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The observed value \(y=4.9\) was marked with a red circle
\item
  The fitted value \(\widehat{y} = 4.369\) on the regression line was marked with a red square
\item
  The residual \(y-\widehat{y} = 4.9-4.369 = 0.531\) was the length of the blue arrow.
\end{itemize}

Let's do this for another arbitrarily chosen instructor whose beauty score was
\(x=2.333\). The residual in this case is \(2.7 - 4.036 = -1.336\).

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-183-1} \end{center}

Another arbitrarily chosen instructor whose beauty score was
\(x=3.667\) results in the residual in this case being \(4.4 - 4.125 = 0.2753\).

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-184-1} \end{center}

Let's do this one more time for another arbitrarily chosen instructor. This instructor had a beauty score of
\(x = 6\). The residual in this case is \(3.8 - 4.28 = -0.4802\).

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/here-1} \end{center}

Now let's say we repeated this process for all 463 instructors in our
dataset. Regression \emph{minimizes the sum of all 463 arrow lengths
squared.} In other words, it minimizes the sum of the squared residuals:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \widehat{y}_i)^2
\]

We square the arrow lengths so that positive and negative deviations of the same amount are treated equally. That's why alternative names for the simple linear regression line are the \textbf{least-squares line} and the \textbf{best fitting line}. It can be proven via calculus and linear algebra that this line uniquely minimizes the sum of the squared arrow lengths.

For the regression line in the plot, the sum of the squared residuals is 131.879. This is the lowest possible value of the sum of the squared residuals of all possible lines we could draw on this scatterplot? How do we know this? We can mathematically prove this fact, but this requires some calculus and linear algebra, so let's leave this proof for another course!

\hypertarget{underthehood}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{get\_regression\_x()} functions}{get\_regression\_x() functions}}\label{underthehood}}

What is going on behind the scenes with the \texttt{get\_regression\_table()} \texttt{get\_regression\_points()} from the \texttt{moderndive} package? Recall we introduced

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In Subsection \ref{model1table}, the \texttt{get\_regression\_table()} function that returned a regression table.
\item
  In Subsection \ref{model1points}, the \texttt{get\_regression\_points()} function that returned information on all \(n\) points/observations involved in a regression?
\end{enumerate}

and that these were examples of \emph{wrapper functions} that takes other pre-existing functions and ``wraps'' them in a single function. This way all the user needs to worry about is the input and the output format, and ignore what's ``under the hood.'' In this subsection we ``lift the hood'' and see how the engine of these wrapper functions work.

First, the \texttt{get\_regression\_table()} wrapper function leverages the

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the \texttt{tidy()} function in the \href{https://broom.tidyverse.org/}{\texttt{broom} package} and
\item
  the \texttt{clean\_names()} function in the \href{https://github.com/sfirke/janitor}{\texttt{janitor} package}
\end{itemize}

to generate tidy data frames with information about a regression model. Here is what the regression table from Subsection \ref{model1table} looks like:

The \texttt{get\_regression\_table()} function takes the above two functions that already existed in other R packages, uses them, and hides the details as seen below.

Note that the \texttt{mutate\_if()} function is from the \texttt{dplyr} package and applies the \texttt{round()} function with 3 significant digits precision only to those variables that are numerical.

Similarly, the second \texttt{get\_regression\_points()} function is another wrapper function, but this time returning information about the points in a regression rather than the regression table. It uses the \texttt{augment()} function in the \href{https://broom.tidyverse.org/}{\texttt{broom} package} instead of \texttt{tidy()} as with \texttt{get\_regression\_points()}.

In this case, it outputs only variables of interest to us as new regression modelers: the outcome variable \(y\) (\texttt{score}), all explanatory/predictor variables (\texttt{bty\_avg}), all resulting \texttt{fitted} values \(\hat{y}\) used by applying the equation of the regression line to \texttt{bty\_avg}, and the \texttt{resid}ual \(y - \hat{y}\).

\subsection{What's to come?}\label{whats-to-come-4}}

In this chapter, you've seen what we call ``basic regression'' when you only have one explanatory variable. In Chapter \ref{multiple-regression}, we'll study \emph{multiple regression} where we have more than one explanatory variable! In particular, we'll see why we've been conducting the residual analyses from Subsections \ref{model1residuals} and \ref{model2residuals}. We are actually verifying some very important assumptions that must be met for the \texttt{std\_error} (standard error), \texttt{p\_value}, \texttt{lower\_ci} and \texttt{upper\_ci} (the end-points of the confidence intervals) columns in our regression tables to have valid interpretation. Again, don't worry for now if you don't understand what these terms mean. After the next chapter on multiple regression, we'll dive in!

\hypertarget{multiple-regression}{%
\chapter{Multiple Regression}\label{multiple-regression}}

In Chapter \ref{regression} we introduced ideas related to modeling, in particular that the fundamental premise of modeling is \emph{to make explicit the relationship} between an outcome variable \(y\) and an explanatory/predictor variable \(x\). Recall further the synonyms that we used to also denote \(y\) as the dependent variable and \(x\) as an independent variable or covariate.

There are many modeling approaches one could take, among the most well-known being linear regression, which was the focus of the last chapter. Whereas in the last chapter we focused solely on regression scenarios where there is only one explanatory/predictor variable, in this chapter, we now focus on modeling scenarios where there is more than one. This case of regression more than one explanatory variable is known as multiple regression. You can imagine when trying to model a particular outcome variable, like teaching evaluation score as in Section \ref{model1} or life expectancy as in Section \ref{model2}, it would be very useful to incorporate more than one explanatory variable.

Since our regression models will now consider more than one explanatory/predictor variable, the interpretation of the associated effect of any one explanatory/predictor variables must be made in conjunction with the others. For example, say we are modeling individuals' incomes as a function of their number of years of education and their parents' wealth. When interpreting the effect of education on income, one has to consider the effect of their parents' wealth at the same time, as these two variables are almost certainly related. Make note of this throughout this chapter and as you work on interpreting the results of multiple regression models into the future.

\section{Two numerical explanatory variables}\label{model3}}

Let's now attempt to identify factors that are associated with how much credit card debt an individual will have. The textbook \href{http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/}{An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R} by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani is an intermediate-level textbook on statistical and machine learning freely available \href{http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR\%20Seventh\%20Printing.pdf}{here}. It has an accompanying R package called \texttt{ISLR} with datasets that the authors use to demonstrate various machine learning methods. One dataset that is frequently used by the authors is the \texttt{Credit} dataset where predictions are made on the credit card balance held by \(n = 400\) credit card holders. These predictions are based on information about them like income, credit limit, and education level. Note that this dataset is not based on actual individuals, it is a simulated dataset used for educational purposes.

Since no information was provided as to who these \(n\) = 400 individuals are and how they came to be included in this dataset, it will be hard to make any scientific claims based on this data. Recall our discussion from the previous chapter that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. That being said, we'll still use \texttt{Credit} to demonstrate multiple regression with:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A numerical outcome variable \(y\), in this case credit card balance.
\item
  Two explanatory variables:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A first numerical explanatory variable \(x_1\). In this case, their credit limit.
  \item
    A second numerical explanatory variable \(x_2\). In this case, their income (in thousands of dollars).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

In the forthcoming Learning Checks, we'll consider a different scenario:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The same numerical outcome variable \(y\): credit card balance.
\item
  Two new explanatory variables:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A first numerical explanatory variable \(x_1\): their credit rating.
  \item
    A second numerical explanatory variable \(x_2\): their age.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{model3EDA}{%

We observe for example:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The mean and median credit card balance are \$520.01 and \$459.50 respectively.
\item
  25\% of card holders had debts of \$68.75 or less.
\item
  The mean and median credit card limit are \$4735.6 and \$4622.50 respectively.
\item
  75\% of these card holders had incomes of \$57,470 or less.
\end{enumerate}

Since our outcome variable \texttt{Balance} and the explanatory variables \texttt{Limit} and
\texttt{Income} are numerical, we can compute the correlation coefficient between pairs
of these variables. First, we could run the \texttt{get\_correlation()} command as seen
in Subsection \ref{model1EDA} twice, once for each explanatory variable:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Credit }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{get_correlation}\NormalTok{(Balance }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{Limit)}

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{get_correlation}\NormalTok{(Balance }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{Income)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Or we can simultaneously compute them by returning a \emph{correlation matrix} in
Table \ref{tab:model3-correlation}. We can read off the correlation coefficient
for any pair of variables by looking them up in the appropriate row/column combination.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Credit }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(Balance, Limit, Income) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{cor}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:model3-correlation}Correlations between credit card balance, credit limit, and income}
\centering
\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\toprule
  & Balance & Limit & Income\\
\midrule
Balance & 1.000 & 0.862 & 0.464\\
Limit & 0.862 & 1.000 & 0.792\\
Income & 0.464 & 0.792 & 1.000\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For example, the correlation coefficient of:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{Balance} with itself is 1 as we would expect based on the definition of the correlation coefficient.
\item
  \texttt{Balance} with \texttt{Limit} is 0.862. This indicates a strong positive linear relationship, which makes sense as only individuals with large credit limits can accrue large credit card balances.
\item
  \texttt{Balance} with \texttt{Income} is 0.464. This is suggestive of another positive linear relationship, although not as strong as the relationship between \texttt{Balance} and \texttt{Limit}.
\item
  As an added bonus, we can read off the correlation coefficient of the two explanatory variables, \texttt{Limit} and \texttt{Income} of 0.792. In this case, we say there is a high degree of \emph{collinearity} between these two explanatory variables.
\end{enumerate}

Collinearity (or multicollinearity) is a phenomenon in which one explanatory variable in a multiple regression model can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. So in this case, if we knew someone's credit card \texttt{Limit} and since \texttt{Limit} and \texttt{Income} are highly correlated, we could make a fairly accurate guess as to that person's \texttt{Income}. Or put loosely, these two variables provided redundant information. For now let's ignore any issues related to collinearity and press on.

Let's visualize the relationship of the outcome variable with each of the two explanatory variables in two separate plots:

\caption{Relationship between credit card balance and credit limit/income}\label{fig:2numxplot1}
\end{figure}

First, there is a positive relationship between credit limit and balance, since as credit limit increases so also does credit card balance; this is to be expected given the strongly positive correlation coefficient of 0.862. In the case of income, the positive relationship doesn't appear as strong, given the weakly positive correlation coefficient of 0.464. However the two plots in Figure \ref{fig:2numxplot1} only focus on the relationship of the outcome variable with each of the explanatory variables independently. To get a sense of the \emph{joint} relationship of all three variables simultaneously through a visualization, let's display the data in a 3-dimensional (3D) scatterplot, where

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The numerical outcome variable \(y\) \texttt{Balance} is on the z-axis (vertical axis)
\item
  The two numerical explanatory variables form the ``floor'' axes. In this case

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The first numerical explanatory variable \(x_1\) \texttt{Income} is on of the floor axes.
  \item
    The second numerical explanatory variable \(x_2\) \texttt{Limit} is on the other floor axis.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\end{center}

Previously in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot4}, we plotted a ``best-fitting'' regression line through a set of points where the numerical outcome variable \(y\) was teaching \texttt{score} and a single numerical explanatory variable \(x\) was \texttt{bty\_avg}. What is the analogous concept when we have \emph{two} numerical predictor variables? Instead of a best-fitting line, we now have a best-fitting \emph{plane}, which is a 3D generalization of lines which exist in 2D.

Just as we did when we had a single numerical explanatory variable \(x\) in Subsection \ref{model1table} and when we had a single categorical explanatory variable \(x\) in Subsection \ref{model2table}, we fit a regression model and obtained the regression table in our two numerical explanatory variable scenario. To fit a regression model and get a table using \texttt{get\_regression\_table()}, we now use a \texttt{+} to consider multiple explanatory variables. In this case since we want to perform a regression of \texttt{Limit} and \texttt{Income} simultaneously, we input \texttt{Balance\ \textasciitilde{}\ Limit\ +\ Income}.

Income & -7.663 & 0.385 & -19.9 & 0 & -8.420 & -6.906\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

How do we interpret these three values that define the regression plane?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Intercept: -\$385.18 (rounded to two decimal points to represent cents). The intercept in our case represents the credit card balance for an individual who has both a credit \texttt{Limit} of \$0 and \texttt{Income} of \$0. In our data however, the intercept has limited practical interpretation as no individuals had \texttt{Limit} or \texttt{Income} values of \$0 and furthermore the smallest credit card balance was \$0. Rather, it is used to situate the regression plane in 3D space.
\item
  Limit: \$0.26. Now that we have multiple variables to consider, we have to add
  a caveat to our interpretation: \emph{taking all other variables in our model into account, for every increase of one unit in credit \texttt{Limit} (dollars), there is an associated increase of on average \$0.26 in credit card balance}. Note:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Just as we did in Subsection \ref{model1table}, we are not making any causal statements, only statements relating to the association between credit limit and balance
  \item
    We need to preface our interpretation of the associated effect of \texttt{Limit} with the statement ``taking all other variables into account'', in this case \texttt{Income}, to emphasize that we are now jointly interpreting the associated effect of multiple explanatory variables in the same model and not in isolation.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Income: -\$7.66. Similarly, \emph{taking all other variables into account, for every increase of one unit in \texttt{Income} (in other words, \$1000 in income), there is an associated decrease of on average \$7.66 in credit card balance}.
\end{itemize}

However, recall in Figure \ref{fig:2numxplot1} that when considered separately, both \texttt{Limit} and \texttt{Income} had positive relationships with the outcome variable \texttt{Balance}. As card holders' credit limits increased their credit card balances tended to increase as well, and a similar relationship held for incomes and balances. In the above multiple regression, however, the slope for \texttt{Income} is now -7.66, suggesting a \emph{negative relationship} between income and credit card balance. What explains these contradictory results?

This is known as Simpson's Paradox, a phenomenon in which a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. We expand on this in Subsection \ref{simpsonsparadox} where we'll look at the relationship between credit \texttt{Limit} and credit card balance but split by different income bracket groups.

\section{One numerical \& one categorical explanatory variable}\label{model4}}

Let's revisit the instructor evaluation data introduced in Section \ref{model1}, where we studied the relationship between instructor evaluation scores and their beauty scores. This analysis suggested that there is a positive relationship between \texttt{bty\_avg} and \texttt{score}, in other words as instructors had higher beauty scores, they also tended to have higher teaching evaluation scores. Now let's say instead of \texttt{bty\_avg} we are interested in the numerical explanatory variable \(x_1\) \texttt{age} and furthermore we want to use a second explanatory variable \(x_2\), the (binary) categorical variable \texttt{gender}.

\textbf{Note}: This study only focused on the gender binary of \texttt{"male"} or \texttt{"female"} when the data was collected and analyzed years ago. It has been tradition to use gender as an ``easy'' binary variable in the past in statistical analyses. We have chosen to include it here because of the interesting results of the study, but we also understand that a segment of the population is not included in this dichotomous assignment of gender and we advocate for more inclusion in future studies to show representation of groups that do not identify with the gender binary. We now resume our analyses using this \texttt{evals} data and hope that others find these results interesting and worth further exploration.

Our modeling scenario now becomes

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A numerical outcome variable \(y\). As before, instructor evaluation score.
\item
  Two explanatory variables:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A numerical explanatory variable \(x_1\): in this case, their age.
  \item
    A categorical explanatory variable \(x_2\): in this case, their binary gender.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{model4EDA}{%

\item
  We can assign a color to points from each of the two levels of \texttt{gender}: female and male.
\item
  Furthermore, the \texttt{geom\_smooth(method\ =\ "lm",\ se\ =\ FALSE)} layer automatically fits a different regression line for each since we have provided \texttt{color\ =\ gender} at the top level in \texttt{ggplot()}. This allows for all \texttt{geom\_}etries that follow to have the same mapping of \texttt{aes()}thetics to variables throughout the plot.

We notice some interesting trends:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  There are almost no women faculty over the age of 60. We can see this by the lack of red dots above 60.
\item
  Fitting separate regression lines for men and women, we see they have different slopes. We see that the associated effect of increasing age seems to be much harsher for women than men. In other words, as women age, the drop in their teaching score appears to be faster.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{model4table}{%
\subsection{Multiple regression: Parallel slopes model}\label{model4table}}

Much like we started to consider multiple explanatory variables using the \texttt{+} sign in Subsection \ref{model3table}, let's fit a regression model and get the regression table. This time we provide the name of \texttt{score\_model\_2} to our regression model fit, in so as to not overwrite the model \texttt{score\_model} from Section \ref{model1table}.

\centering
\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrr}
\toprule

intercept & 4.484 & 0.125 & 35.79 & 0.000 & 4.238 & 4.730\\

gendermale & 0.191 & 0.052 & 3.63 & 0.000 & 0.087 & 0.294\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The modeling equation for this scenario is:

\begin{align}
\widehat{y} &= b_0 + b_1 \cdot x_1 + b_2 \cdot x_2 \\
\widehat{\mbox{score}} &= b_0 + b_{\mbox{age}} \cdot \mbox{age} + b_{\mbox{male}} \cdot \mathbb{1}_{\mbox{is male}}(x)
\end{align}

where \(\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{is male}}(x)\) is an \emph{indicator function} for \texttt{sex\ ==\ male}. In other words, \(\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{is male}}(x)\) equals one if the current observation corresponds to a male professor, and 0 if the current observation corresponds to a female professor. This model can be visualized in Figure \ref{fig:numxcatxplot2}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/numxcatxplot2-1} 

}

\caption{Instructor evaluation scores at UT Austin by gender: same slope}\label{fig:numxcatxplot2}
\end{figure}

We see that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Females are treated as the baseline for comparison for no other reason than ``female'' is alphabetically earlier than ``male.'' The \(b_{male} = 0.1906\) is the vertical ``bump'' that men get in their teaching evaluation scores. Or more precisely, it is the average difference in teaching score
  that men get \emph{relative to the baseline of women}.
\item
  Accordingly, the intercepts (which in this case make no sense since no instructor can have an age of 0) are :

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    for women: \(b_0\) = 4.484
  \item
    for men: \(b_0 + b_{male}\) = 4.484 + 0.191 = 4.675
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Both men and women have the same slope. In other words, \emph{in this model} the associated effect of age is the same for men and women. So for every increase of one year in age, there is on average an associated change of \(b_{age}\) = -0.009 (a decrease) in teaching score.
\end{itemize}

But wait, why is Figure \ref{fig:numxcatxplot2} different than Figure \ref{fig:numxcatxplot1}! What is going on? What we have in the original plot is known as an \emph{interaction effect} between age and gender. Focusing on fitting a model for each of men and women, we see that the resulting regression lines are different. Thus, \texttt{gender} appears to interact in different ways for men and women with the different values of \texttt{age}.

\hypertarget{model4interactiontable}{%
\subsection{Multiple regression: Interaction model}\label{model4interactiontable}}

We say a model has an \emph{interaction effect} if the associated effect of one variable \emph{depends on the value of another variable}. These types of models usually prove to be tricky to view on first glance because of their complexity. In this case, the effect of \texttt{age} will depend on the value of \texttt{gender}. Put differently, the effect of age on teaching scores will differ for men and for women, as was suggested by the different slopes for men and women in our visual exploratory data analysis in Figure \ref{fig:numxcatxplot1}.

Let's fit a regression with an interaction term. Instead of using the \texttt{+} sign in the enumeration of explanatory variables, we use the \texttt{*} sign. Let's fit this regression and save it in \texttt{score\_model\_3}, then we get the regression table using the \texttt{get\_regression\_table()} function as before.

\begin{Shaded}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The modeling equation for this scenario is:

\begin{align}
\widehat{y} &= b_0 + b_1 \cdot x_1 + b_2 \cdot x_2 + b_3 \cdot x_1 \cdot x_2\\
\widehat{\mbox{score}} &= b_0 + b_{\mbox{age}} \cdot \mbox{age} + b_{\mbox{male}} \cdot \mathbb{1}_{\mbox{is male}}(x) + b_{\mbox{age,male}} \cdot \mbox{age} \cdot \mathbb{1}_{\mbox{is male}}(x)
\end{align}

Oof, that's a lot of rows in the regression table output and a lot of terms in the model equation. The fourth term being added on the right hand side of the equation corresponds to the \emph{interaction term}. Let's simplify things by considering men and women separately. First, recall that \(\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{is male}}(x)\) equals 1 if a particular observation (or row in \texttt{evals\_ch7}) corresponds to a male instructor. In this case, using the values from the regression table the fitted value of \(\widehat{\mbox{score}}\) is:

\begin{align}
\widehat{\mbox{score}} &= b_0 + b_{\mbox{age}} \cdot \mbox{age} + b_{\mbox{male}} \cdot \mathbb{1}_{\mbox{is male}}(x) + b_{\mbox{age,male}} \cdot \mbox{age} \cdot \mathbb{1}_{\mbox{is male}}(x) \\
&= b_0 + b_{\mbox{age}} \cdot \mbox{age} + b_{\mbox{male}} \cdot 1 + b_{\mbox{age,male}} \cdot \mbox{age} \cdot 1 \\
&= \left(b_0 + b_{\mbox{male}}\right) + \left(b_{\mbox{age}} +  b_{\mbox{age,male}} \right) \cdot \mbox{age} \\
&= \left(4.883 + -0.446\right) + \left(-0.018 +  0.014 \right) \cdot \mbox{age} \\
&= 4.437 -0.004 \cdot \mbox{age}
\end{align}

Second, recall that \(\mathbb{1}_{\mbox{is male}}(x)\) equals 0 if a particular observation corresponds to a female instructor. Again, using the values from the regression table the fitted value of \(\widehat{\mbox{score}}\) is:

\begin{align}
\widehat{\mbox{score}} &= b_0 + b_{\mbox{age}} \cdot \mbox{age} + b_{\mbox{male}} \cdot \mathbb{1}_{\mbox{is male}}(x) + b_{\mbox{age,male}} \cdot \mbox{age} \cdot \mathbb{1}_{\mbox{is male}}(x) \\
&= b_0 + b_{\mbox{age}} \cdot \mbox{age} + b_{\mbox{male}} \cdot 0 + b_{\mbox{age,male}}\mbox{age} \cdot 0 \\
&= b_0 + b_{\mbox{age}} \cdot \mbox{age}\\
&= 4.883 -0.018 \cdot \mbox{age}
\end{align}

Let's summarize these values in a table:

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-223}Comparison of male and female intercepts and age slopes}
\centering
\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
Gender & Intercept & Slope for age\\
\midrule
Male instructors & 4.44 & -0.004\\
Female instructors & 4.88 & -0.018\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We see that while male instructors have a lower intercept, as they age, they have a less steep associated average decrease in teaching scores: 0.004 teaching score units per year as opposed to -0.018 for women. This is consistent with the different slopes and intercepts of the red and blue regression lines fit in Figure \ref{fig:numxcatxplot1}. Recall our definition of a model having an interaction effect: when the associated effect of one variable, in this case \texttt{age}, depends on the value of another variable, in this case \texttt{gender}.

But how do we know when it's appropriate to include an interaction effect? For example, which is the more appropriate model? The regular multiple regression model without an interaction term we saw in Section \ref{model4table} or the multiple regression model with the interaction term we just saw? We'll revisit this question in Chapter \ref{inference-for-regression} on ``inference for regression.''

\hypertarget{model4points}{%
\subsection{Observed/fitted values and residuals}\label{model4points}}

Now say we want to apply the above calculations for male and female instructors for all 463 instructors in the \texttt{evals\_ch7} dataset. As our multiple regression models get more and more complex, computing such values by hand gets more and more tedious. The \texttt{get\_regression\_points()} function spares us this tedium and returns all fitted values and all residuals. For simplicity, let's focus only on the fitted interaction model, which is saved in \texttt{score\_model\_interaction}.

\hypertarget{simpsonsparadox}{%
\subsection{Simpson's Paradox}\label{simpsonsparadox}}

Recall in Section \ref{model3}, we saw the two following seemingly contradictory results when studying the relationship between credit card balance, credit limit, and income. On the one hand, the right hand plot of Figure \ref{fig:2numxplot1} suggested that credit card balance and income were positively related:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-226-1} 

}

\caption{Relationship between credit card balance and credit limit/income}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-226}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, the multiple regression in Table \ref{tab:model3-table-output}, suggested that when modeling credit card balance as a function of both credit limit and income at the same time, credit limit has a negative relationship with balance, as evidenced by the slope of -7.66. How can this be?

First, let's dive a little deeper into the explanatory variable \texttt{Limit}. Figure \ref{fig:credit-limit-quartiles} shows a histogram of all 400 values of \texttt{Limit}, along with vertical red lines that cut up the data into quartiles, meaning:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  25\% of credit limits were between \$0 and \$3088. Let's call this the ``low'' credit limit bracket.
\item
  25\% of credit limits were between \$3088 and \$4622. Let's call this the ``medium-low'' credit limit bracket.
\item
  25\% of credit limits were between \$4622 and \$5873. Let's call this the ``medium-high'' credit limit bracket.
\item
  25\% of credit limits were over \$5873. Let's call this the ``high'' credit limit bracket.
\end{enumerate}

`binwidth`.

\caption{Histogram of credit limits and quartiles}\label{fig:credit-limit-quartiles}

Let's now display

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The scatterplot showing the relationship between credit card balance and limit (the right-hand plot of Figure \ref{fig:2numxplot1}).
\item
  The scatterplot showing the relationship between credit card balance and limit now with a color aesthetic added corresponding to the credit limit bracket.

In the right-hand plot, the

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Red points (bottom-left) correspond to the low credit limit bracket.
\item
  Green points correspond to the medium-low credit limit bracket.
\item
  Blue points correspond to the medium-high credit limit bracket.
\item
  Purple points (top-right) correspond to the high credit limit bracket.
\end{itemize}

The left-hand plot focuses of the relationship between balance and income in aggregate, but the right-hand plot focuses on the relationship between balance and income \emph{broken down by credit limit bracket}. Whereas in aggregate there is an overall positive relationship, when broken down we now see that for the low (red points), medium-low (green points), and medium-high (blue points) income bracket groups, the strong positive relationship between credit card balance and income disappears! Only for the high bracket does the relationship stay somewhat positive. In this example, credit limit is a \emph{confounding variable} for credit card balance and income.

Once we've covered Chapters \ref{sampling} on sampling, \ref{confidence-intervals} on confidence intervals, and \ref{hypothesis-testing} on hypothesis testing, we'll come back to the models we've seen in ``data modeling'' in Chapter \ref{inference-for-regression} on inference for regression.

We are actually verifying some very important assumptions that must be met for the \texttt{std\_error} (standard error), \texttt{p\_value}, \texttt{conf\_low} and \texttt{conf\_high} (the end-points of the confidence intervals) columns in our regression tables to have valid interpretation. Up next:

\chapter{Sampling}\label{sampling}}

In this chapter we kick off the third segment of this book, statistical inference, by learning about \textbf{sampling}. The concepts behind sampling form the basis of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, which we'll cover in Chapters \ref{confidence-intervals} and \ref{hypothesis-testing} respectively. We will see that the tools that you learned in the data science segment of this book, in particular data visualization and data wrangling, will also play an important role here in the development of your understanding. As mentioned before, the concepts throughout this text all build into a culmination allowing you to ``think with data.''

\hypertarget{sampling-activity}{%
\section{Sampling activity}\label{sampling-activity}}

Let's start with a hands-on activity.

\hypertarget{what-proportion-of-this-bowls-balls-are-red}{%
\subsection{What proportion of this bowl's balls are red?}\label{what-proportion-of-this-bowls-balls-are-red}}

Take a look at the bowl in Figure \ref{fig:sampling-exercise-1}. It has a certain number of red and a certain number of white balls all of equal size. Furthermore, it appears the bowl has been mixed beforehand as there does not seem to be any particular pattern to the spatial distribution of red and white balls.

Let's now ask ourselves, what proportion of this bowl's balls are red?

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/sampling_bowl_1} 

}

\caption{A bowl with red and white balls.}\label{fig:sampling-exercise-1}
\end{figure}

One way to answer this question would be to perform an exhaustive count: remove each ball individually, count the number of red balls and the number of white balls, and divide the number of red balls by the total number of balls. However this would be a long and tedious process.

\hypertarget{using-the-shovel-once}{%
\subsection{Using the shovel once}\label{using-the-shovel-once}}

Instead of performing an exhaustive count, let's insert a shovel into the bowl as seen in Figure \ref{fig:sampling-exercise-2}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/sampling_bowl_2} 

}

\caption{Inserting a shovel into the bowl.}\label{fig:sampling-exercise-2}
\end{figure}

Using the shovel we remove a number of balls as seen in Figure \ref{fig:sampling-exercise-3}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/sampling_bowl_3_cropped} 

}

\caption{Fifty balls from the bowl.}\label{fig:sampling-exercise-3}
\end{figure}

Observe that 17 of the balls are red and there are a total of 5 x 10 = 50 balls and thus 0.34 = 34\% of the shovel's balls are red. We can view the proportion of balls that are red \emph{in this shovel} as a guess of the proportion of balls that are red \emph{in the entire bowl}. While not as exact as doing an exhaustive count, our guess of 34\% took much less time and energy to obtain.

However, say, we started this activity over from the beginning. In other words, we replace the 50 balls back into the bowl and start over. Would we remove exactly 17 red balls again? In other words, would our guess at the proportion of the bowl's balls that are red be exactly 34\% again? Maybe?

What if we repeated this exercise several times? Would I obtain exactly 17 red balls each time? In other words, would our guess at the proportion of the bowl's balls that are red be exactly 34\% every time? Surely not. Let's actually do and observe the results with the help of 33 of our friends.

\hypertarget{student-shovels}{%
\subsection{Using the shovel 33 times}\label{student-shovels}}

Each of our 33 friends will do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  use the shovel to remove 50 balls each,
\item
  count the number of red balls,
\item
  use this number to compute the proportion of the 50 balls they removed that are red,
\item
  return the balls into the bowl, and
\item
  mix the contents of the bowl a little to not let a previous group's results influence the next group's set of results.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{images/sampling/tactile_2_a} \includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{images/sampling/tactile_2_b} \includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{images/sampling/tactile_2_c} 

}

\caption{Repeating sampling activity 33 times.}\label{fig:sampling-exercise-3b}
\end{figure}

However, before returning the balls into the bowl, they are going to mark the proportion of the 50 balls they removed that are red in a histogram as seen in Figure \ref{fig:sampling-exercise-4}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/sampling/tactile_3_a} 

}

\caption{Constructing a histogram of proportions.}\label{fig:sampling-exercise-4}
\end{figure}

Recall from Section \ref{histograms} that histograms allow us to visualize the \emph{distribution} of a numerical variable: where the values center and in particular how they vary. The resulting hand-drawn histogram can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:sampling-exercise-5}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/sampling/tactile_3_c} 

}

\caption{Hand-drawn histogram of 33 proportions.}\label{fig:sampling-exercise-5}
\end{figure}

Observe the following about the histogram in Figure \ref{fig:sampling-exercise-5}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  At the low end, one group removed 50 balls from the bowl with proportion between 0.20 = 20\% and 0.25 = 25\%
\item
  At the high end, another group removed 50 balls from the bowl with proportion between 0.45 = 45\% and 0.5 = 50\% red.
\item
  However the most frequently occurring proportions were between 0.30 = 30\% and 0.35 = 35\% red, right in the middle of the distribution.
\item
  The shape of this distribution is somewhat bell-shaped.
\end{itemize}

Let's construct this same hand-drawn histogram in R using your data visualization skills that you honed in Chapter \ref{viz}. We saved our 33 group of friends' proportion red in a data frame \texttt{tactile\_prop\_red} which is included in the \texttt{moderndive} package you loaded earlier.

Observe for each \texttt{group} we have their names, the number of \texttt{red\_balls} they obtained, and the corresponding proportion out of 50 balls that were red named \texttt{prop\_red}. Observe, we also have a variable \texttt{replicate} enumerating each of the 33 groups; we chose this name because each row can be viewed as one instance of a replicated activity: using the shovel to remove 50 balls and computing the proportion of those balls that are red.

We visualize the distribution of these 33 proportions using a \texttt{geom\_histogram()} with \texttt{binwidth\ =\ 0.05} in Figure \ref{fig:samplingdistribution-tactile}, which is appropriate since the variable \texttt{prop\_red} is numerical. This computer-generated histogram matches our hand-drawn histogram from the earlier Figure \ref{fig:sampling-exercise-5}.

\hypertarget{what-are-we-doing-here}{%
\subsection{What are we doing here?}\label{what-are-we-doing-here}}

What we just demonstrated in this activity is the statistical concept of \emph{sampling}. We would like to know the proportion of the bowl's balls that are red, but because the bowl has a very large number of balls performing an exhaustive count of the number of red and white balls in the bowl would be very costly in terms of both time and energy. We therefore extract a sample of 50 balls using the shovel. Using this sample of 50 balls, we estimate the proportion of the bowl's balls that are red using the proportion of the shovel's balls that are red. This estimate in our earlier example was 17 red balls out of 50 balls = 34\%. Moreover, because we mixed the balls before each use of the shovel, the samples were randomly drawn. Because each sample was drawn at random, the samples were different from each other. Because the samples were different from each other, we obtained the different proportions red observed in Table \ref{tab:tactilered}. This is known as the concept of \emph{sampling variation}.

In Section \ref{sampling-simulation} we'll mimic the hands-on sampling activity we just performed in a \emph{computer simulation}; using a computer will allow us to repeat the above sampling activity much more than 33 times. Using a computer, not only will be able to repeat the hands-on activity a very large number of times, but we will also be able to repeat it using different sized shovels.

The purpose of these simulations is to develop an understanding of two key concepts relating to sampling: understanding the concept of sampling variation and the role that sample size plays in this variation. To this end, we'll present you with definitions, terminology, and notation related to sampling in Section \ref{sampling-framework}. As with many disciplines, there are definitions, terminology, and notation that seem very inaccessible and even confusing at first. However, as with many difficult topics, if you truly understand the underlying concepts and practice, practice, practice, you'll be able to master these topics.

To tie the contents of this chapter to the real-word, we'll present an example of one of the most recognizable uses of sampling: polls. In Section \ref{sampling-case-study} we'll look at a particular case study: a 2013 poll on then President Obama's popularity among young Americans, conducted by the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics.

We'll close this chapter by generalizing the above sampling from the bowl activity to other scenarios, distinguishing between \emph{random sampling} and \emph{random assignment}, presenting the theoretical result underpinning all our results, and presenting a few mathematical formulas that relate to the concepts and ideas explored in this chapter.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{sampling-simulation}{%
\section{Computer simulation}\label{sampling-simulation}}

What we performed in Section \ref{sampling-activity} is a \emph{simulation} of sampling. In other words, we were not in a real-life sampling scenario in order to answer a real-life question, but rather we were mimicking such a scenario with our bowl and shovel. The crowd-sourced Wikipedia definition of a simulation states: ``A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system.''\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation}{Wikipedia entry for simulation}} One example of simulations in practice are a flight simulators: before pilots in training are allowed to fly an actual plane, they first practice on a computer that attempts to mimic the reality of flying an actual plane as best as possible.

Now you might be thinking that simulations must necessarily take place on computer. However, this is not necessarily true. Take for example crash test dummies: before cars are made available to the market, automobile engineers test their safety by mimicking the reality for passengers of being in an automobile crash. To distinguish between these two simulation types, we'll term a simulation performed in real-life as a ``tactile'' simulation done with your hands and to the touch as opposed to a ``virtual'' simulation performed on a computer.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

So while in Section \ref{sampling-activity} we performed a ``tactile'' simulation of sampling using an actual bowl and an actual shovel with our hands, in this section we'll perform a ``virtual'' simulation using a ``virtual'' bowl and a ``virtual'' shovel with our computers.

\hypertarget{using-the-virtual-shovel-once}{%
\subsection{Using the virtual shovel once}\label{using-the-virtual-shovel-once}}

Let's start by performing the virtual analogue of the tactile sampling simulation we performed in \ref{sampling-activity}. We first need a virtual analogue of the bowl seen in Figure \ref{fig:sampling-exercise-1}. To this end, we included a data frame \texttt{bowl} in the \texttt{moderndive} package whose rows correspond exactly with the contents of the actual bowl.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bowl}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 2,400 x 2
   ball_ID color
     <int> <chr>
 1       1 white
 2       2 white
 3       3 white
 4       4 red  
 5       5 white
 6       6 white
 7       7 red  
 8       8 white
 9       9 red  
10      10 white
# ... with 2,390 more rows
\end{verbatim}

Observe in the output that \texttt{bowl} has 2400 rows, telling us that the bowl contains 2400 equally-sized balls. The first variable \texttt{ball\_ID} is used merely as an ``identification variable'' for this data frame as discussed in Subsection \ref{identification-vs-measurement-variables}; none of the balls in the actual bowl are marked with numbers. The second variable \texttt{color} indicates whether a particular virtual ball is red or white. View the contents of the bowl in RStudio's data viewer and scroll through the contents to convince yourselves that \texttt{bowl} is indeed a virtual version of the actual bowl in Figure \ref{fig:sampling-exercise-1}.

Now that we have a virtual analogue of our bowl, we now need a virtual analogue for the shovel seen in Figure \ref{fig:sampling-exercise-2}; we'll use this virtual shovel to generate our virtual random samples of 50 balls. We're going to use the \texttt{rep\_sample\_n()} function included in the \texttt{moderndive} package. This function allows us to take \texttt{rep}eated, or \texttt{rep}licated, \texttt{samples} of size \texttt{n}. Run the following and explore \texttt{virtual\_shovel}'s contents in the RStudio viewer.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's display only the first 10 out of 50 rows of \texttt{virtual\_shovel}'s contents in Table \ref{tab:virtual-shovel}.

\begin{table}[H]

\end{table}

The \texttt{ball\_ID} variable identifies which of the balls from \texttt{bowl} are included in our sample of 50 balls and \texttt{color} denotes its color. However what does the \texttt{replicate} variable indicate? In \texttt{virtual\_shovel}'s case, \texttt{replicate} is equal to 1 for all 50 rows. This is telling us that these 50 rows correspond to a first repeated/replicated use of the shovel, in our case our first sample. We'll see below when we ``virtually'' take 33 samples, \texttt{replicate} will take values between 1 and 33. Before we do this, let's compute the proportion of balls in our virtual sample of size 50 that are red using the \texttt{dplyr} data wrangling verbs you learned in Chapter \ref{wrangling}. Let's breakdown the steps individually:

First, for each of our 50 sampled balls, identify if it is red using a test for equality using \texttt{==}. For every row where \texttt{color\ ==\ "red"}, the Boolean \texttt{TRUE} is returned and for every row where \texttt{color} is not equal to \texttt{"red"}, the Boolean \texttt{FALSE} is returned. Let's create a new Boolean variable \texttt{is\_red} using the \texttt{mutate()} function from Section \ref{mutate}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{virtual_shovel }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{is_red =}\NormalTok{ (color }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "red"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 50 x 4
# Groups:   replicate [1]
   replicate ball_ID color is_red
       <int>   <int> <chr> <lgl> 
 1         1    1500 white FALSE 
 2         1    1767 red   TRUE  
 3         1    1035 white FALSE 
 4         1     245 white FALSE 
 5         1    1121 white FALSE 
 6         1    1828 white FALSE 
 7         1     721 white FALSE 
 8         1    1729 red   TRUE  
 9         1     770 white FALSE 
10         1    1499 red   TRUE  
# ... with 40 more rows
\end{verbatim}

Second, we compute the number of balls out of 50 that are red using the \texttt{summarize()} function. Recall from Section \ref{summarize} that \texttt{summarize()} takes a data frame with many rows and returns a data frame with a single row containing summary statistics that you specify, like \texttt{mean()} and \texttt{median()}. In this case we use the \texttt{sum()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{virtual_shovel }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{is_red =}\NormalTok{ (color }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "red"}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{num_red =} \KeywordTok{sum}\NormalTok{(is_red))  }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 2
  replicate num_red
      <int>   <int>
1         1      17
\end{verbatim}

Why does this work? Because R treats \texttt{TRUE} like the number \texttt{1} and \texttt{FALSE} like the number \texttt{0}. So summing the number of \texttt{TRUE}'s and \texttt{FALSE}'s is equivalent to summing \texttt{1}'s and \texttt{0}'s, which in the end counts the number of balls where \texttt{color} is \texttt{red}. In our case, 17 of the 50 balls were red.

Third and last, we compute the proportion of the 50 sampled balls that are red by dividing \texttt{num\_red} by 50:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{virtual_shovel }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{is_red =}\NormalTok{ color }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "red"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{num_red =} \KeywordTok{sum}\NormalTok{(is_red)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{prop_red =}\NormalTok{ num_red }\OperatorTok{/}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{50}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 3
  replicate num_red prop_red
      <int>   <int>    <dbl>
1         1      17     0.34
\end{verbatim}

In other words, this ``virtual'' sample's balls were 34\% red. Let's make the above code a little more compact and succinct by combining the first \texttt{mutate()} and the \texttt{summarize()} as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{virtual_shovel }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{num_red =} \KeywordTok{sum}\NormalTok{(color }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "red"}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{prop_red =}\NormalTok{ num_red }\OperatorTok{/}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{50}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 3
  replicate num_red prop_red
      <int>   <int>    <dbl>
1         1      17     0.34
\end{verbatim}

Great! 34\% of \texttt{virtual\_shovel}'s 50 balls were red! So based on this particular sample, our guess at the proportion of the \texttt{bowl}'s balls that are red is 34\%. But remember from our earlier tactile sampling activity that if we repeated this sampling, we would not necessarily obtain a sample of 50 balls with 34\% of them being red again; there will likely be some variation. In fact in Table \ref{tab:virtual-shovel} we displayed 33 such proportions based on 33 tactile samples and then in Figure \ref{fig:sampling-exercise-5} we visualized the distribution of the 33 proportions in a histogram. Let's now perform the virtual analogue of having 33 groups of students use the sampling shovel!

\hypertarget{using-the-virtual-shovel-33-times}{%
\subsection{Using the virtual shovel 33 times}\label{using-the-virtual-shovel-33-times}}

Recall that in our tactile sampling exercise in Section \ref{sampling-activity} we had 33 groups of students each use the shovel, yielding 33 samples of size 50 balls, which we then used to compute 33 proportions. In other words we repeated/replicated using the shovel 33 times. We can perform this repeated/replicated sampling virtually by once again using our virtual shovel function \texttt{rep\_sample\_n()}, but by adding the \texttt{reps\ =\ 33} argument, indicating we want to repeat the sampling 33 times. Be sure to scroll through the contents of \texttt{virtual\_samples} in RStudio's viewer.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{virtual_samples <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{bowl }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{rep_sample_n}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{size =} \DecValTok{50}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{reps =} \DecValTok{33}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{View}\NormalTok{(virtual_samples)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Observe that while the first 50 rows of \texttt{replicate} are equal to \texttt{1}, the next 50 rows of \texttt{replicate} are equal to \texttt{2}. This is telling us that the first 50 rows correspond to the first sample of 50 balls while the next 50 correspond to the second sample of 50 balls. This pattern continues for all \texttt{reps\ =\ 33} replicates and thus \texttt{virtual\_samples} has 33 \(\times\) 50 = 1650 rows.

Let's now take the data frame \texttt{virtual\_samples} with 33 \(\times\) 50 = 1650 rows corresponding to 33 samples of size 50 balls and compute the resulting 33 proportions red. We'll use the same \texttt{dplyr} verbs as we did in the previous section, but this time with an additional \texttt{group\_by()} of the \texttt{replicate} variable. Recall from Section \ref{groupby} that by assigning the grouping variable ``meta-data'' before \texttt{summarizing()}, we'll obtain 33 different proportions red:

Let's display only the first 10 out of 33 rows of \texttt{virtual\_prop\_red}'s contents in Table \ref{tab:tactilered}. As one would expect, there is variation in the resulting \texttt{prop\_red} proportions red for the first 10 out 33 repeated/replicated samples.

Let's visualize the distribution of these 33 proportions red based on 33 virtual samples using a histogram with \texttt{binwidth\ =\ 0.05} in Figure \ref{fig:samplingdistribution-virtual}.

\end{figure}

Observe that occasionally we obtained proportions red that are less than 0.3 = 30\%, while on the other hand we occasionally we obtained proportions that are greater than 0.45 = 45\%. However, the most frequently occurring proportions red out of 50 balls were between 35\% and 40\% (for 11 out 33 samples). Why do we have these differences in proportions red? Because of sampling variation.

Let's now compare our virtual results with our tactile results from the previous section in Figure \ref{fig:tactile-vs-virtual}. We see that both histograms, in other words the distribution of the 33 proportions red, are \emph{somewhat} similar in their center and spread although not identical. These slight differences are again due to random variation. Furthermore both distributions are \emph{somewhat} bell-shaped.

\subsection{Using the virtual shovel 1000 times}\label{using-the-virtual-shovel-1000-times}}

Now say we want study the variation in proportions red not based on 33 repeated/replicated samples, but rather a very large number of samples say 1000 samples. We have two choices at this point. We could have our students manually take 1000 samples of 50 balls and compute the corresponding 1000 proportion red out 50 balls. This would be cruel and unusual however, as this would be very tedious and time-consuming. This is where computers excel: automating long and repetitive tasks while performing them very quickly. Therefore at this point we will abandon tactile sampling in favor of only virtual sampling. Let's once again use the \texttt{rep\_sample\_n()} function with sample \texttt{size} set to 50 once again, but this time with the number of replicates \texttt{reps\ =\ 1000}. Be sure to scroll through the contents of \texttt{virtual\_samples} in RStudio's viewer.

Once again, the most frequently occurring proportions red occur between 35\% and 40\%. Every now and then, we obtain proportions as low as between 20\% and 25\%, and others as high as between 55\% and 60\%. These are rare however. Furthermore observe that we now have a much more symmetric and smoother bell-shaped distribution. This distribution is in fact a Normal distribution; see Appendix \ref{appendixA} for a brief discussion on properties of the Normal distribution.

\subsection{Using different shovels}\label{using-different-shovels}}

Now say instead of just one shovel, you had three choices of shovels to extract a sample of balls with.

\end{longtable}

If your goal was still to estimate the proportion of the bowl's balls that were red, which shovel would you choose? In our experience, most people would choose the shovel with 100 slots since it has the biggest sample size and hence would yield the ``best'' guess of the proportion of the bowl's 2400 balls that are red. Using our newly developed tools for virtual sampling simulations, let's unpack the effect of having different sample sizes! In other words, let's use \texttt{rep\_sample\_n()} with \texttt{size\ =\ 25}, \texttt{size\ =\ 50}, and \texttt{size\ =\ 100}, while keeping the number of repeated/replicated samples at 1000:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Virtually use the appropriate shovel to generate 1000 samples with \texttt{size} balls.
\item
  Compute the resulting 1000 replicated of the proportion of the shovel's balls that are red.
\item
  Visualize the distribution of these 1000 proportion red using a histogram.
\end{enumerate}

For easy comparison, we present the three resulting histograms in a single row with matching x and y axes in Figure \ref{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions}. What do you observe?

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/comparing-sampling-distributions-1} 

}

\caption{Comparing the distributions of proportion red for different sample sizes}\label{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions}
\end{figure}

Observe that as the sample size increases, the spread of the 1000 replicates of the proportion red decreases. In other words, as the sample size increases, there are less differences due to sampling variation and the distribution centers more tightly around the same value. Eyeballing Figure \ref{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions}, things appear to center tightly around roughly 40\%.

We can be numerically explicit about the amount of spread in our 3 sets of 1000 values of \texttt{prop\_red} using the \emph{standard deviation}: a summary statistic that measures the amount of spread and variation within a numerical variable; see Appendix \ref{appendixA} for a brief discussion on properties of the standard deviation. For all three sample sizes, let's compute the standard deviation of the 1000 proportions red by running the following data wrangling code that uses the \texttt{sd()} summary function.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's compare these 3 measures of spread of the distributions in Table \ref{tab:comparing-n}.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:comparing-n}Comparing standard deviations of proportions red for 3 different shovels.}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As we observed visually in Figure \ref{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions}, as the sample size increases our numerical measure of spread decreases; there is less variation in our proportions red. In other words, as the sample size increases, our guesses at the true proportion of the bowl's balls that are red get more consistent and precise.

\hypertarget{sampling-framework}{%
\section{Sampling framework}\label{sampling-framework}}

In both our ``hands-on'' tactile simulations and our ``virtual'' simulations using a computer, we used sampling for the purpose of estimation: we extract samples in order to estimate the proportion of the bowl's balls that are red. We used sampling as a cheaper and less-time consuming approach than to do a full census of all the balls. Our virtual simulations all built up to the results shown in Figure \ref{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions} and Table \ref{tab:comparing-n}, comparing 1000 proportions red based on samples of size 25, 50, and 100. This was our first attempt at understanding two key concepts relating to sampling for estimation:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The effect of sampling variation on our estimates.
\item
  The effect of sample size on sampling variation.
\end{enumerate}

Let's now introduce some terminology and notation as well as statistical definitions related to sampling. Given the number of new words to learn, you will likely have to read these next three subsections multiple times. Keep in mind however that none of the concepts underlying these terminology, notation, and definitions are any different than the concepts underlying our simulations in Sections \ref{sampling-activity} and \ref{sampling-simulation}; it will simply take time and practice to master them.

\hypertarget{terminology-notation}{%
\subsection{Terminology \& notation}\label{terminology-notation}}

Here is a list of terminology and mathematical notation relating to sampling. For each item, we'll be sure to tie them to our simulations in Sections \ref{sampling-activity} and \ref{sampling-simulation}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{(Study) Population}: A (study) population is a collection of individuals or observations about which we are interested. We mathematically denote the population's size using upper case \(N\). In our simulations the (study) population was the collection of \(N\) = 2400 identically sized red and white balls contained in the bowl.
\item
  \textbf{Population parameter}: A population parameter is a numerical summary quantity about the population that is unknown, but you wish you knew. For example, when this quantity is a mean, the population parameter of interest is the \emph{population mean} which is mathematically denoted with the Greek letter \(\mu\) (pronounced ``mu''). In our simulations however since we were interested in the proportion of the bowl's balls that were red, the population parameter is the \emph{population proportion} which is mathematically denoted with the letter \(p\).
\item
  \textbf{Census}: An exhaustive enumeration or counting of all \(N\) individuals or observations in the population in order to compute the population parameter's value \emph{exactly}. In our simulations, this would correspond to manually going over all \(N\) = 2400 balls in the bowl and counting the number that are red and computing the population proportion \(p\) of the balls that are red \emph{exactly}. When the number \(N\) of individuals or observations in our population is large, as was the case with our bowl, a census can be very expensive in terms of time, energy, and money.
\item
  \textbf{Sampling}: Sampling is the act of collecting a sample from the population when we don't have the means to perform a census. We mathematically denote the sample's size using lower case \(n\), as opposed to upper case \(N\) which denotes the population's size. Typically the sample size \(n\) is much smaller than the population size \(N\), thereby making sampling a much cheaper procedure than a census. In our simulations, we used shovels with 25, 50, and 100 slots to extract a sample of size \(n\) = 25, \(n\) = 50, and \(n\) = 100 balls.
\item
  \textbf{Point estimate (AKA sample statistic)}: A summary statistic computed from the sample that \emph{estimates} the unknown population parameter. In our simulations, recall that the unknown population parameter was the population proportion and that this is mathematically denoted with \(p\). Our point estimate is the \emph{sample proportion}: the proportion of the shovel's balls that are red. In other words, it is our guess of the proportion of the bowl's balls balls that are red. We mathematically denote the sample proportion using \(\widehat{p}\); the ``hat'' on top of the \(p\) indicates that it is an estimate of the unknown population proportion \(p\).
\item
  \textbf{Representative sampling}: A sample is said be a \emph{representative sample} if it is representative of the population. In other words, are the sample's characteristics a good representation of the population's characteristics? In our simulations, are the samples of \(n\) balls extracted using our shovels representative of the bowl's \(N\)=2400 balls?
\item
  \textbf{Generalizability}: We say a sample is \emph{generalizable} if any results based on the sample can generalize to the population. In other words, can the value of the point estimate be generalized to estimate the value of the population parameter well? In our simulations, can we generalize the values of the sample proportions red of our shovels to the population proportion red of the bowl? Using mathematical notation, is \(\widehat{p}\) a ``good guess'' of \(p\)?
\item
  \textbf{Bias}: In a statistical sense, we say \emph{bias} occurs if certain individuals or observations in a population have a higher chance of being included in a sample than others. We say a sampling procedure is \emph{unbiased} if every observation in a population had an equal chance of being sampled. In our simulations, since each ball had the same size and hence an equal chance of being sample in our shovels, our samples were unbiased.
\item
  \textbf{Random sampling}: We say a sampling procedure is \emph{random} if we sample randomly from the population in an unbiased fashion. In our simulations, this would correspond to sufficiently mixing the bowl before each use of the shovel.
\end{enumerate}

Phew, that's a lot of new terminology and notation to learn! Let's put them all together to describe the paradigm of sampling:

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the sampling of a sample of size \(n\) is done at \textbf{random}, then
\item
  the sample is \textbf{unbiased} and \textbf{representative} of the population of size \(N\), thus
\item
  any result based on the sample can \textbf{generalize} to the population, thus
\item
  the point estimate is a \textbf{``good guess''} of the unknown population parameter, thus
\item
  instead of performing a census, we can \textbf{infer} about the population using sampling.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

Restricting consideration to a shovel with 50 slots from our simulations,

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If we extract a sample of \(n=50\) balls at \textbf{random}, in other words we mix the equally-sized balls before using the shovel, then
\item
  the contents of the shovel are an \textbf{unbiased representation} of the contents of the bowl's 2400 balls, thus
\item
  any result based on the sample of balls can \textbf{generalize} to the bowl, thus
\item
  the sample proportion \(\widehat{p}\) of the \(n=50\) balls in the shovel that are red is a \textbf{``good guess''} of the population proportion \(p\) of the \(N\)=2400 balls that are red, thus
\item
  instead of manually going over all the balls in the bowl, we can \textbf{infer} about the bowl using the shovel.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

Note that last word we wrote in bold: \textbf{infer}. The act of ``inferring'' is to deduce or conclude (information) from evidence and reasoning. In our simulations, we wanted to infer about the proportion of the bowl's balls that are red. \emph{Statistical inference} is the theory, methods, and practice of forming judgments about the parameters of a population and the reliability of statistical relationships, typically on the basis of random sampling (Wikipedia). In other words, statistical inference is the act of inference via sampling. In the upcoming Chapter \ref{confidence-intervals} on confidence intervals, we'll introduce the \texttt{infer} package, which makes statistical inference ``tidy'' and transparent. It is why this third portion of the book is called ``Statistical inference via infer''.

\hypertarget{statistical-definitions}{%
\subsection{Statistical definitions}\label{statistical-definitions}}

Now for some important statistical definitions related to sampling. As a refresher of our 1000 repeated/replicated virtual samples of size \(n\) = 25, \(n\) = 50, and \(n\) = 100 in Section \ref{sampling-simulation}, let's display Figure \ref{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions} again below.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-247-1} \end{center}

These types of distributions have a special name: \textbf{sampling distributions}; their visualization displays the effect of sampling variation on the distribution of any point estimate, in this case the sample proportion \(\widehat{p}\). Using these sampling distributions, for a given sample size \(n\), we can make statements about what values we can typically expect. For example, observe the centers of all three sampling distributions: they are all roughly centered around 0.4 = 40\%. Furthermore, observe that while we are somewhat likely to observe sample proportions red of 0.2 = 20\% when using the shovel with 25 slots, we will almost never observe this sample proportion when using the shovel with 100 slots. Observe also the effect of sample size on the sampling variation. As the sample size \(n\) increases from 25 to 50 to 100, the spread/variation of the sampling distribution decreases and thus the values cluster more and more tightly around the same center of around 40\%. We quantified this spread/variation using the standard deviation of our proportions in Table \ref{tab:comparing-n}, which we display again below:

\begin{tabular}{r|r}
\hline
Number of slots in shovel & Standard deviation of proportions red\\
\hline
25 & 0.099\\
\hline
50 & 0.071\\
\hline
100 & 0.048\\

So as the number of slots in the shovel increased, this standard deviation decreased. These types of standard deviations have another special name: \textbf{standard errors}; they quantify the effect of sampling variation induced on our estimates. In other words, they are quantifying how much we can expect different proportions of a shovel's balls that are red to vary from random sample to random sample.

Unfortunately, many new statistics practitioners get confused by these names. For example, it's common for people new to statistical inference to call the ``sampling distribution'' the ``sample distribution''. Another additional source of confusion is the name ``standard deviation'' and ``standard error''. Remember that a standard error is merely a \emph{kind} of standard deviation: the standard deviation of any point estimate from a sampling scenario. In other words, all standard errors are standard deviations, but not all standard deviations are a standard error.

To help reinforce these concepts, let's re-display Figure \ref{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions} but using our new terminology, notation, and definitions relating to sampling in Figure \ref{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-2}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/comparing-sampling-distributions-2-1} 

}

\caption{Three sampling distributions of the sample proportion $\widehat{p}$.}\label{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-2}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, let's re-display Table \ref{tab:comparing-n} but using our new terminology, notation, and definitions relating to sampling in Table \ref{tab:comparing-n-2}.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:comparing-n-2}Three standard errors of the sample proportion $\widehat{p}$ based on n = 25, 50, 100. }

n = 25 & 0.099\\
n = 50 & 0.071\\
n = 100 & 0.048\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Remember the key message of this last table: that as the sample size \(n\) goes up, the ``typical'' error of your point estimate as quantified by the standard error will go down.

\hypertarget{the-moral-of-the-story}{%
\subsection{The moral of the story}\label{the-moral-of-the-story}}

Let's recap this section so far. We've seen that if a sample is generated at random, then the resulting point estimate is a ``good guess'' of the true unknown population parameter. In our simulations, since we made sure to mix the balls first before extracting a sample with the shovel, the resulting sample proportion \(\widehat{p}\) of the shovel's balls that were red was a ``good guess'' of the population proportion \(p\) of the bowl's balls that were red.

However, what do we mean by our point estimate being a ``good guess''? While sometimes we'll obtain a point estimate less than the true value of the unknown population parameter, other times we'll obtain a point estimate greater than the true value of the unknown population parameter, this is because of sampling variation. However despite this sampling variation, our point estimates will ``on average'' be correct. In our simulations, sometimes our sample proportion \(\widehat{p}\) was less than the true population proportion \(p\), other times the sample proportion \(\widehat{p}\) was greater than the true population proportion \(p\). This was due to the sampling variability induced by the mixing. However despite this sampling variation, our sample proportions \(\widehat{p}\) were always centered around the true population proportion. This is also known as having an \textbf{accurate} estimate.

What was the value of the population proportion \(p\) of the \(N\) = 2400 balls in the actual bowl? There were 900 red balls, for a proportion red of 900/2400 = 0.375 = 37.5\%! How do we know this? Did the authors do an exhaustive count of all the balls? No! They were listed on the contexts of the box that the bowl came in. Hence we made the contents of the virtual \texttt{bowl} match the tactile bowl:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bowl }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{sum_red =} \KeywordTok{sum}\NormalTok{(color }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "red"}\NormalTok{), }
            \DataTypeTok{sum_not_red =} \KeywordTok{sum}\NormalTok{(color }\OperatorTok{!=}\StringTok{ "red"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 2
  sum_red sum_not_red
    <int>       <int>
1     900        1500
\end{verbatim}

Let's re-display our sampling distributions from Figures \ref{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions} and \ref{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-2}, but now with a vertical red line marking the true population proportion \(p\) of balls that are red = 37.5\% in Figure \ref{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-3}. We see that while there is a certain amount of error in the sample proportions \(\widehat{p}\) for all three sampling distributions, on average the \(\widehat{p}\) are centered at the true population proportion red \(p\).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/comparing-sampling-distributions-3-1} 

}

\caption{Three sampling distributions with population proportion $p$ marked in red.}\label{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-3}
\end{figure}

We also saw in this section that as your sample size \(n\) increases, your point estimates will vary less and less and be more and more concentrated around the true population parameter; this is quantified by the decreasing standard error. In other words, the typical error of your point estimates will decrease. In our simulations, as the sample size increases, the spread/variation of our sample proportions \(\widehat{p}\) around the true population proportion \(p\) decreases. You can observe this behavior as well in Figure \ref{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-3}. This is also known as having a more \textbf{precise} estimate.

So random sampling ensures our point estimates are accurate, while having a large sample size ensures our point estimates are precise. While accuracy and precision may sound like the same concept, they are actually not. Accuracy relates to how ``on target'' our estimates are whereas precision relates to how ``consistent'' our estimates are. Figure \ref{fig:accuracy-vs-precision} illustrates the difference.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/accuracy_vs_precision} 

}

\caption{Comparing accuracy and precision}\label{fig:accuracy-vs-precision}
\end{figure}

As this point you might be asking yourself: ``If you already knew the true proportion of the bowl's balls that are red was 37.5\%, then what did we do any of this for?'' In other words, ``If you already knew the value of the true unknown population parameter, then why did we do any sampling?'' You might also be asking: ``Why did we take 1000 repeated/replicated samples of size n = 25, 50, and 100? Shouldn't we be taking only \emph{one} sample that's as large as possible?'' Recall our definition of a simulation from Section \ref{sampling-simulation}: an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system. We performed these simulations to study:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The effect of sampling variation on our estimates.
\item
  The effect of sample size on sampling variation.
\end{enumerate}

In a real-life scenario, we won't know what the true value of the population parameter is and furthermore we won't take repeated/replicated samples but rather a single sample that's as large as we can afford. This was also done to show the power of the technique of sampling when trying to estimate a population parameter. Since we knew the value was 37.5\%, we could show just how well the different sample sizes approximated this value in their sampling distributions. We present one case study of a real-life sampling scenario in the next section: polling.

\section{Case study: Polls}\label{sampling-case-study}}

In December 4, 2013 National Public Radio in the US reported on a recent, at the time, poll of President Obama's approval rating among young Americans aged 18-29 in an article \href{https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/12/04/248793753/poll-support-for-obama-among-young-americans-eroding}{Poll: Support For Obama Among Young Americans Eroding}. A quote from the article:

\begin{quote}
After voting for him in large numbers in 2008 and 2012, young Americans are souring on President Obama.

According to a new Harvard University Institute of Politics poll, just 41 percent of millennials --- adults ages 18-29 --- approve of Obama's job performance, his lowest-ever standing among the group and an 11-point drop from April.
\end{quote}

Let's tie elements of the real-life poll in this new article with our ``tactile'' and ``virtual'' simulations from Sections \ref{sampling-activity} and \ref{sampling-simulation} using the terminology, notations, and definitions we learned in Section \ref{sampling-framework}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{(Study) Population}: Who is the population of \(N\) individuals or observations of interest?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Simulation: \(N\) = 2400 identically-sized red and white balls
  \item
    Obama poll: \(N\) = ? young Americans aged 18-29
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Population parameter}: What is the population parameter?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Simulation: The population proportion \(p\) of ALL the balls in the bowl that are red.
  \item
    Obama poll: The population proportion \(p\) of ALL young Americans who approve of Obama's job performance.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Census}: What would a census look like?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Simulation: Manually going over all \(N\) = 2400 balls and exactly computing the population proportion \(p\) of the balls that are red, a time consuming task.
  \item
    Obama poll: Locating all \(N\) = ? young Americans and asking them all if they approve of Obama's job performance, an expensive task.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Sampling}: How do you collect the sample of size \(n\) individuals or observations?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Simulation: Using a shovel with \(n\) slots.
  \item
    Obama poll: One method is to get a list of phone numbers of all young Americans and pick out \(n\) phone numbers. In this poll's case, the sample size of this poll was \(n\) = 2089 young Americans.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Point estimate (AKA sample statistic)}: What is your estimate of the unknown population parameter?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Simulation: The sample proportion \(\widehat{p}\) of the balls in the shovel that were red.
  \item
    Obama poll: The sample proportion \(\widehat{p}\) of young Americans in the sample that approve of Obama's job performance. In this poll's case, \(\widehat{p}\) = 0.41 = 41\%, the quoted percentage in the second paragraph of the article.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Representative sampling}: Is the sampling procedure \emph{representative}?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Simulation: Are the contents of the shovel representative of the contents of the bowl?
  \item
    Obama poll: Is the sample of \(n\) = 2089 young Americans representative of all young Americans aged 18-29?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Generalizability}: Are the samples \emph{generalizable} to the greater population?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Simulation: Is the sample proportion \(\widehat{p}\) of the shovel's balls that are red a ``good guess'' of the population proportion \(p\) of the bowl's balls that are red?
  \item
    Obama poll: Is the sample proportion \(\widehat{p}\) = 0.41 of the sample of young Americans who support Obama a ``good guess'' of the population proportion \(p\) of all young Americans who support Obama? In other words, can we confidently say that 41\% of \emph{all} young Americans approve of Obama?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Bias}: Is the sampling procedure unbiased? In other words, do all observations have an equal chance of being included in the sample?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Simulation: Since each ball was equally sized, each ball had an equal chance of being included in a shovel's sample, and hence the sampling was unbiased.
  \item
    Obama poll: Did all young Americans have an equal chance at being represented in this poll? For example, if this was conducted using only mobile phone numbers, would people without mobile phones be included? What if those who disapproved of Obama were less likely to agree to take part in the poll? What about if this were an internet poll on a certain news website? Would non-readers of this website be included? We need to ask the Harvard University Institute of Politics pollsters about their \emph{sampling methodology}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Random sampling}: Was the sampling random?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Simulation: As long as you mixed the bowl sufficiently before sampling, your samples would be random.
  \item
    Obama poll: Was the sample conducted at random? We need to ask the Harvard University Institute of Politics pollsters about their \emph{sampling methodology}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Once again, let's revisit the sampling paradigm:

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the sampling of a sample of size \(n\) is done at \textbf{random}, then
\item
  the sample is \textbf{unbiased} and \textbf{representative} of the population of size \(N\), thus
\item
  any result based on the sample can \textbf{generalize} to the population, thus
\item
  the point estimate is a \textbf{``good guess''} of the unknown population parameter, thus
\item
  instead of performing a census, we can \textbf{infer} about the population using sampling.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

In our simulations using the shovel with 50 slots:

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If we extract a sample of \(n\) = 50 balls at \textbf{random}, in other words we mix the equally-sized balls before using the shovel, then
\item
  the contents of the shovel are an \textbf{unbiased representation} of the contents of the bowl's 2400 balls, thus
\item
  any result based on the sample of balls can \textbf{generalize} to the bowl, thus
\item
  the sample proportion \(\widehat{p}\) of the \(n\) = 50 balls in the shovel that are red is a \textbf{``good guess''} of the population proportion \(p\) of the \(N\) = 2400 balls that are red, thus
\item
  instead of manually going over all the balls in the bowl, we can \textbf{infer} about the bowl using the shovel.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

In the in-real life Obama poll:

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If we had a way of contacting a \textbf{randomly} chosen sample of 2089 young Americans and poll their approval of Obama, then
\item
  these 2089 young Americans would be an \textbf{unbiased} and \textbf{representative} sample of \emph{all} young Americans, thus
\item
  any results based on this sample of 2089 young Americans can \textbf{generalize} to the entire population of all young Americans, thus
\item
  the reported sample approval rating of 41\% of these 2089 young Americans is a \textbf{good guess} of the true approval rating among all young Americans, thus
\item
  instead of performing a highly costly census of all young Americans, we can \textbf{infer} about all young Americans using polling.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Central Limit Theorem}\label{sampling-conclusion-central-limit-theorem}}

What you did in Sections \ref{sampling-activity} and \ref{sampling-simulation} (in particular in Figure \ref{fig:comparing-sampling-distributions} and Table \ref{tab:comparing-n}) was demonstrate a very famous theorem, or mathematically proven truth, called the \emph{Central Limit Theorem}. It loosely states that when sample means and sample proportions are based on larger and larger sample sizes, the sampling distribution of these two point estimates become more and more normally shaped and more and more narrow. In other words, their sampling distributions become more normally distributed and the spread/variation of these sampling distributions as quantified by their standard errors gets smaller. Shuyi Chiou, Casey Dunn, and Pathikrit Bhattacharyya created the following 3m38s video at \url{https://www.youtube.com/embed/jvoxEYmQHNM} explaining this crucial statistical theorem using the average weight of wild bunny rabbits and the average wing span of dragons as examples. Enjoy!

\hypertarget{sampling-conclusion-table}{%
\subsection{Summary table}\label{sampling-conclusion-table}}

In this chapter, we performed both tactile and virtual simulations of sampling to infer about an unknown proportion. We also presented a case study of a sampling in real life situation: polls. In both cases, we used the sample proportion \(\widehat{p}\) to estimate the population proportion \(p\). However, we are not just limited to scenarios related statistical inference for proportions. In other words, we can consider other population parameter and point estimate scenarios than just the population proportion \(p\) and sample proportion \(\widehat{p}\) scenarios we studied in this chapter. We present 5 more such scenarios in Table \ref{tab:summarytable-ch8}.

Note that the sample mean is traditionally noted as \(\overline{x}\) but can also be thought of as an estimate of the population mean \(\mu\). Thus, it can also be denoted as \(\widehat{\mu}\) as shown below in the table.

Recall in our Obama poll case study in Section \ref{sampling-case-study} that based on this particular sample, the Harvard University Institute of Politics' best guess of Obama's approval rating among all young Americans was 41\%. However, this isn't the end of the story. If you read further in the article, it states:

\begin{quote}
The online survey of 2,089 adults was conducted from Oct.~30 to Nov.~11, just weeks after the federal government shutdown ended and the problems surrounding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act began to take center stage. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 2.1 percentage points.
\end{quote}

Note the term \emph{margin of error}, which here is plus or minus 2.1 percentage points. What this is saying is that most polls won't get it perfectly right; there will always be a certain amount of error caused by \emph{sampling variation}. The margin of error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points is saying that a typical range of errors for polls of this type is about \(\pm\) 2.1\%, in words from about 2.1\% too small to about 2.1\% too big for an interval of {[}41\% - 2.1\%, 41\% + 2.1\%{]} = {[}37.9\%, 43.1\%{]}. Remember that this notation corresponds to 37.9\% and 43.1\% being included as well as all numbers between the two of them. We'll see in the next chapter that such intervals are known as \emph{confidence intervals}.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

In Chapter \ref{sampling}, we explored the process of sampling from a representative sample to build a sampling distribution. The motivation there was to use multiple samples from the same population to visualize and attempt to understand the variability in the statistic from one sample to another. Furthermore, recall our concepts and terminology related to sampling from the beginning of Chapter \ref{sampling}:

Generally speaking, we learned that if the sampling of a sample of size \(n\) is done at \emph{random}, then the resulting sample is \emph{unbiased} and \emph{representative} of the \emph{population}, thus any result based on the sample can \emph{generalize} to the population, and hence the \textbf{point estimate/sample statistic} computed from this sample is a ``good guess'' of the unknown population parameter of interest

Specific to the bowl, we learned that if we properly mix the balls first thereby ensuring the randomness of samples extracted using the shovel with \(n=50\) slots, then the contents of the shovel will ``look like'' the contents of the bowl, thus any results based on the sample of \(n=50\) balls can generalize to the large bowl of \(N=2400\) balls, and hence the sample proportion red \(\widehat{p}\) of the \(n=50\) balls in the shovel is a ``good guess'' of the true population proportion red \(p\) of the \(N=2400\) balls in the bowl.

We emphasize that we used a point estimate/sample statistic, in this case the sample proportion \(\widehat{p}\), to estimate the unknown value of the population parameter, in this case the population proportion \(p\). In other words, we are using the sample to \textbf{infer} about the population.

We can however consider inferential situations other than just those involving proportions. We present a wide array of such scenarios in Table \ref{tab:summarytable}. In all 7 cases, the point estimate/sample statistic \emph{estimates} the unknown population parameter. It does so by computing summary statistics based on a sample of size \(n\).

We'll cover the first four scenarios in this chapter on confidence intervals and the following one on hypothesis testing:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Scenario 2 about means. Ex: the average age of pennies.
\item
  Scenario 3 about differences in proportions between two groups. Ex: the difference in high school completion rates for Canadians vs non-Canadians. We call this a situation of \emph{two-sample} inference.
\item
  Scenario 4 is similar to 3, but its about the means of two groups. Ex: the difference in average test scores for the morning section of a class versus the afternoon section of a class. This is another situation of \emph{two-sample} inference.
\end{itemize}

In Chapter \ref{inference-for-regression} on inference for regression, we'll cover Scenarios 5 \& 6 about the regression line. In particular we'll see that the fitted regression line from Chapter \ref{regression} on basic regression, \(\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \cdot x\), is in fact an estimate of some true population regression line \(y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x\) based on a sample of \(n\) pairs of points \((x, y)\). Ex: Recall our sample of \(n=463\) instructors at the UT Austin from the \texttt{evals} data set in Chapter \ref{regression}. Based on the results of the fitted regression model of teaching score with beauty score as an explanatory/predictor variable, what can we say about this relationship for \emph{all} instructors, not just those at the UT Austin?

In contrast to these, Scenario 7 involves a measure of spread: the standard deviation. Does the spread/variability of a sample match the spread/variability of the population? However, we leave this topic for a more intermediate course on statistical inference.

In most cases, we don't have the population values as we did with the \texttt{bowl} of balls. We only have a single sample of data from a larger population. We'd like to be able to make some reasonable guesses about population parameters using that single sample to create a range of plausible values for a population parameter. This range of plausible values is known as a \textbf{confidence interval} and will be the focus of this chapter. And how do we use a single sample to get some idea of how other samples might vary in terms of their statistic values? One common way this is done is via a process known as \textbf{bootstrapping} that will be the focus of the beginning sections of this chapter.

The \texttt{pennies\_sample} data frame has rows corresponding to a single penny with two variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{year} of minting as shown on the penny and
\item
  \texttt{age\_in\_2011} giving the years the penny had been in circulation from 2011 as an integer, e.g.~15, 2, etc.
\end{itemize}

Suppose we are interested in understanding some properties of the mean age of \textbf{all} US pennies from this data collected in 2011. How might we go about that? Let's begin by understanding some of the properties of \texttt{pennies\_sample} using data wrangling from Chapter \ref{wrangling} and data visualization from Chapter \ref{viz}.

\hypertarget{exploratory-data-analysis}{%
\subsection{Exploratory data analysis}\label{exploratory-data-analysis}}

First, let's visualize the values in this sample as a histogram:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(pennies_sample, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ age_in_}\DecValTok{2011}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_histogram}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{bins =} \DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{color =} \StringTok{"white"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-255-1} \end{center}

We see a roughly symmetric distribution here that has quite a few values near 20 years in age with only a few larger than 40 years or smaller than 5 years. If \texttt{pennies\_sample} is a representative sample from the population, we'd expect the age of all US pennies collected in 2011 to have a similar shape, a similar spread, and similar measures of central tendency like the mean.

So where does the mean value fall for this sample? This point will be known as our \textbf{point estimate} and provides us with a single number that could serve as the guess to what the true population mean age might be. Recall how to find this using the \texttt{dplyr} package:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x_bar <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{pennies_sample }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{stat =} \KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(age_in_}\DecValTok{2011}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{x_bar}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1
   stat
  <dbl>
1  25.1
\end{verbatim}

We've denoted this \emph{sample mean} as \(\bar{x}\), which is the standard symbol for denoting the mean of a sample. Our point estimate is, thus, \(\bar{x} = 25.1\). Note that this is just one sample though providing just one guess at the population mean. What if we'd like to have another guess?

This should all sound similar to what we did in Chapter \ref{sampling}. There instead of collecting just a single scoop of balls we had many different students use the shovel to scoop different samples of red and white balls. We then calculated a sample statistic (the sample proportion) from each sample. But, we don't have a population to pull from here with the pennies. We only have this one sample.

The process of \textbf{bootstrapping} allows us to use a single sample to generate many different samples that will act as our way of approximating a sampling distribution using a created \textbf{bootstrap distribution} instead. We will pull ourselves up from our bootstraps using a single sample (\texttt{pennies\_sample}) to get an idea of the grander sampling distribution.

\hypertarget{bootstrap-process}{%
\subsection{The Bootstrapping Process}\label{bootstrap-process}}

Bootstrapping uses a process of sampling \textbf{with replacement} from our original sample to create new \textbf{bootstrap samples} of the \emph{same} size as our original sample. We can again make use of the \texttt{rep\_sample\_n()} function to explore what one such bootstrap sample would look like. Remember that we are randomly sampling from the original sample here with replacement and that we always use the same sample size for the bootstrap samples as the size of the original sample (\texttt{pennies\_sample}).

\begin{Shaded}

10         1  1994          17
# ... with 30 more rows
\end{verbatim}

Let's visualize what this new bootstrap sample looks like:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(bootstrap_sample1, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ age_in_}\DecValTok{2011}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{+}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-259-1} \end{center}

We now have another sample from what we could assume comes from the population of interest. We can similarly calculate the sample mean of this bootstrap sample, called a \textbf{bootstrap statistic}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bootstrap_sample1 }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{stat =} \KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(age_in_}\DecValTok{2011}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 2
  replicate  stat
      <int> <dbl>
1         1  23.2
\end{verbatim}

We can see that this sample mean is smaller than the \texttt{x\_bar} value we calculated earlier for the \texttt{pennies\_sample} data. We'll come back to analyzing the different bootstrap statistic values shortly.

Let's recap what was done to get to this bootstrap sample using a tactile explanation:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  First, pretend that each of the 40 values of \texttt{age\_in\_2011} in \texttt{pennies\_sample} were written on a small piece of paper. Recall that these values were 6, 30, 34, 19, 6, etc.
\item
  Now, put the 40 small pieces of paper into a receptacle such as a baseball cap.
\item
  Shake up the pieces of paper.
\item
  Draw ``at random'' from the cap to select one piece of paper.
\item
  Write down the value on this piece of paper. Say that it is 28.
\item
  Now, place this piece of paper containing 28 back into the cap.
\item
  Draw ``at random'' again from the cap to select a piece of paper. Note that this is the \emph{sampling with replacement} part since you may draw 28 again.
\item
  Repeat this process until you have drawn 40 pieces of paper and written down the values on these 40 pieces of paper. Completing this repetition produces ONE bootstrap sample.
\end{enumerate}

If you look at the values in \texttt{bootstrap\_sample1}, you can see how this process plays out. We originally drew 28, then we drew 11, then 7, and so on. Of course, we didn't actually use pieces of paper and a cap here. We just had the computer perform this process for us to produce \texttt{bootstrap\_sample1} using \texttt{rep\_sample\_n()} with \texttt{replace\ =\ TRUE} set.

The process of \emph{sampling with replacement} is how we can use the original sample to take a guess as to what other values in the population may be. Sometimes in these bootstrap samples, we will select lots of larger values from the original sample, sometimes we will select lots of smaller values, and most frequently we will select values that are near the center of the sample. Let's explore what the distribution of values of \texttt{age\_in\_2011} for six different bootstrap samples looks like to further understand this variability.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{six_bootstrap_samples <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{pennies_sample }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{rep_sample_n}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{size =} \DecValTok{40}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{replace =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{reps =} \DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(six_bootstrap_samples, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ age_in_}\DecValTok{2011}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{+}

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{facet_wrap}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{replicate)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-262-1} \end{center}

We can also look at the six different means using \texttt{dplyr} syntax:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{six_bootstrap_samples }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(replicate) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{stat =} \KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(age_in_}\DecValTok{2011}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 6 x 2
  replicate  stat
      <int> <dbl>
1         1  23.6
2         2  24.1
3         3  25.2
4         4  23.1
5         5  24.0
6         6  24.7
\end{verbatim}

Instead of doing this six times, we could do it 1000 times and then look at the distribution of \texttt{stat} across all 1000 of the \texttt{replicate}s. This sets the stage for the \texttt{infer} R package \citep{R-infer} that was created to help users perform statistical inference such as confidence intervals and hypothesis tests using verbs similar to what you've seen with \texttt{dplyr}. We'll walk through setting up each of the \texttt{infer} verbs for confidence intervals using this \texttt{pennies\_sample} example, while also explaining the purpose of the verbs in a general framework.

\hypertarget{the-infer-package-for-statistical-inference}{%
\section{The infer package for statistical inference}\label{the-infer-package-for-statistical-inference}}

The \texttt{infer} package makes great use of the \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%} to create a pipeline for statistical inference. The goal of the package is to provide a way for its users to explain the computational process of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests using the code as a guide. The verbs build in order here, so you'll want to start with \texttt{specify()} and then continue through the others as needed.

\hypertarget{specify-variables}{%
\subsection{Specify variables}\label{specify-variables}}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/flowcharts/infer/specify} \end{center}

The \texttt{specify()} function is used primarily to choose which variables will be the focus of the statistical inference. In addition, a setting of which variable will act as the \texttt{explanatory} and which acts as the \texttt{response} variable is done here. For proportion problems similar to those in Chapter \ref{sampling}, we can also give which of the different levels we would like to have as a \texttt{success}. We'll see further examples of these options in this chapter, Chapter \ref{hypothesis-testing}, and in Appendix \ref{appendixB}.

To begin to create a confidence interval for the population mean age of US pennies in 2011, we start by using \texttt{specify()} to choose which variable in our \texttt{pennies\_sample} data we'd like to work with. This can be done in one of two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Using the \texttt{response} argument:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pennies_sample }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{specify}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{response =}\NormalTok{ age_in_}\DecValTok{2011}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Response: age_in_2011 (integer)
# A tibble: 40 x 1
   age_in_2011
         <int>
 1           6
 2          30
 3          34
 4          19
 5           6
 6           5
 7          11
 8          19
 9          23
10          15
# ... with 30 more rows
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Using \texttt{formula} notation:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pennies_sample }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{specify}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{formula =}\NormalTok{ age_in_}\DecValTok{2011} \OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\OtherTok{NULL}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Response: age_in_2011 (integer)
# A tibble: 40 x 1
   age_in_2011
         <int>
 1           6
 2          30
 3          34
 4          19
 5           6
 6           5
 7          11
 8          19
 9          23
10          15
# ... with 30 more rows
\end{verbatim}

Note that the formula notation uses the common R methodology to include the response \(y\) variable on the left of the \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} and the explanatory \(x\) variable on the right of the ``tilde.'' Recall that you used this notation frequently with the \texttt{lm()} function in Chapters \ref{regression} and \ref{multiple-regression} when fitting regression models. Either notation works just fine, but a preference is usually given here for the \texttt{formula} notation to further build on the ideas from earlier chapters.

\hypertarget{generate-replicates}{%
\subsection{Generate replicates}\label{generate-replicates}}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/flowcharts/infer/generate} \end{center}

After \texttt{specify()}ing the variables we'd like in our inferential analysis, we next feed that into the \texttt{generate()} verb. The \texttt{generate()} verb's main argument is \texttt{reps}, which is used to give how many different repetitions one would like to perform. Another argument here is \texttt{type}, which is automatically determined by the kinds of variables passed into \texttt{specify()}. We can also be explicit and set this \texttt{type} to be \texttt{type\ =\ "bootstrap"}. This \texttt{type} argument will be further used in hypothesis testing in Chapter \ref{hypothesis-testing} as well. Make sure to check out \texttt{?generate} to see the options here and use the \texttt{?} operator to better understand other verbs as well.

Let's \texttt{generate()} 1000 bootstrap samples:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{thousand_bootstrap_samples <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{pennies_sample }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{specify}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{response =}\NormalTok{ age_in_}\DecValTok{2011}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{generate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{reps =} \DecValTok{1000}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Setting `type = "bootstrap"` in `generate()`.
\end{verbatim}

We can use the \texttt{dplyr} \texttt{count()} function to help us understand what the \texttt{thousand\_bootstrap\_samples} data frame looks like:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{thousand_bootstrap_samples }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{count}\NormalTok{(replicate)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1,000 x 2
# Groups:   replicate [1,000]
   replicate     n
       <int> <int>
 1         1    40
 2         2    40
 3         3    40
 4         4    40
 5         5    40
 6         6    40
 7         7    40
 8         8    40
 9         9    40
10        10    40
# ... with 990 more rows
\end{verbatim}

Notice that each \texttt{replicate} has 40 entries here. Now that we have 1000 different bootstrap samples, our next step is to \texttt{calculate} the bootstrap statistics for each sample.

\hypertarget{calculate-summary-statistics}{%
\subsection{Calculate summary statistics}\label{calculate-summary-statistics}}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/flowcharts/infer/calculate} \end{center}

After \texttt{generate()}ing many different samples, we next want to condense those samples down into a single statistic for each \texttt{replicate}d sample. As seen in the diagram, the \texttt{calculate()} function is helpful here.

As we did at the beginning of this chapter, we now want to calculate the mean \texttt{age\_in\_2011} for each bootstrap sample. To do so, we use the \texttt{stat} argument and set it to \texttt{"mean"} below. The \texttt{stat} argument has a variety of different options here and we will see further examples of this throughout the remaining chapters.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bootstrap_distribution <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{pennies_sample }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{specify}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{response =}\NormalTok{ age_in_}\DecValTok{2011}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{calculate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{stat =} \StringTok{"mean"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Setting `type = "bootstrap"` in `generate()`.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bootstrap_distribution}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1,000 x 2
   replicate  stat
       <int> <dbl>
 1         1  26.5
 2         2  25.4
 3         3  26.0
 4         4  26  
 5         5  25.2
 6         6  29.0
 7         7  22.8
 8         8  26.4
 9         9  24.9
10        10  28.1
# ... with 990 more rows
\end{verbatim}

We see that the resulting data has 1000 rows and 2 columns corresponding to the 1000 replicates and the mean for each bootstrap sample.

\hypertarget{observed-statistic-point-estimate-calculations}{%
\subsubsection*{Observed statistic / point estimate calculations}\label{observed-statistic-point-estimate-calculations}}


Just as \texttt{group\_by()\ \%\textgreater{}\%\ summarize()} produces a useful workflow in \texttt{dplyr}, we can also use \texttt{specify()\ \%\textgreater{}\%\ calculate()} to compute summary measures on our original sample data. It's often helpful both in confidence interval calculations, but also in hypothesis testing to identify what the corresponding statistic is in the original data. For our example on penny age, we computed above a value of \texttt{x\_bar} using the \texttt{summarize()} verb in \texttt{dplyr}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pennies_sample }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{stat =} \KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(age_in_}\DecValTok{2011}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1
   stat
  <dbl>
1  25.1
\end{verbatim}

This can also be done by skipping the \texttt{generate()} step in the pipeline feeding \texttt{specify()} directly into \texttt{calculate()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pennies_sample }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{specify}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{response =}\NormalTok{ age_in_}\DecValTok{2011}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{calculate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{stat =} \StringTok{"mean"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1
   stat
  <dbl>
1  25.1
\end{verbatim}

This shortcut will be particularly useful when the calculation of the observed statistic is tricky to do using \texttt{dplyr} alone. This is particularly the case when working with more than one variable as will be seen in Chapter \ref{hypothesis-testing}.

\hypertarget{visualize-the-results}{%
\subsection{Visualize the results}\label{visualize-the-results}}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/flowcharts/infer/visualize} \end{center}

The \texttt{visualize()} verb provides a simple way to view the bootstrap distribution as a histogram of the \texttt{stat} variable values. It has many other arguments that one can use as well including the shading of the histogram values corresponding to the confidence interval values.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bootstrap_distribution }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-275-1} \end{center}

The shape of this resulting distribution may look familiar to you. It resembles the well-known normal (bell-shaped) curve.

The following diagram recaps the \texttt{infer} pipeline for creating a bootstrap distribution.

\hypertarget{now-to-confidence-intervals}{%
\section{Now to confidence intervals}\label{now-to-confidence-intervals}}

\textbf{Definition: Confidence Interval}

A \emph{confidence interval} gives a range of plausible values for a parameter. It depends on a specified \emph{confidence level} with higher confidence levels corresponding to wider confidence intervals and lower confidence levels corresponding to narrower confidence intervals. Common confidence levels include 90\%, 95\%, and 99\%.

Usually we don't just begin sections with a definition, but \emph{confidence intervals} are simple to define and play an important role in the sciences and any field that uses data. You can think of a confidence interval as playing the role of a net when fishing. Instead of just trying to catch a fish with a single spear (estimating an unknown parameter by using a single point estimate/statistic), we can use a net to try to provide a range of possible locations for the fish (use a range of possible values based around our statistic to make a plausible guess as to the location of the parameter).

The bootstrapping process will provide bootstrap statistics that have a bootstrap distribution with center at (or extremely close to) the mean of the original sample. This can be seen by giving the observed statistic \texttt{obs\_stat} argument the value of the point estimate \texttt{x\_bar}.

\begin{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-277-1} \end{center}

We can also compute the mean of the bootstrap distribution of means to see how it compares to \texttt{x\_bar}:

In this case, we can see that the bootstrap distribution provides us a guess as to what the variability in different sample means may look like only using the original sample as our guide. We can quantify this variability in the form of a 95\% confidence interval in a couple different ways.

\hypertarget{percentile-method}{%
\subsection{The percentile method}\label{percentile-method}}

One way to calculate a range of plausible values for the unknown mean age of coins in 2011 is to use the middle 95\% of the \texttt{bootstrap\_distribution} to determine our endpoints. Our endpoints are thus at the 2.5\textsuperscript{th} and 97.5\textsuperscript{th} percentiles. This can be done with \texttt{infer} using the \texttt{get\_ci()} function. (You can also use the \texttt{conf\_int()} or \texttt{get\_confidence\_interval()} functions here as they are aliases that work the exact same way.)

\begin{Shaded}

  `2.5%` `97.5%`
   <dbl>   <dbl>
1   21.0    29.3
\end{verbatim}

These options are the default values for \texttt{level} and \texttt{type} so we can also just do:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{percentile_ci <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{bootstrap_distribution }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

1   21.0    29.3
\end{verbatim}

Using the percentile method, our range of plausible values for the mean age of US pennies in circulation in 2011 is 20.972 years to 29.252 years. We can use the \texttt{visualize()} function to view this using the \texttt{endpoints} and \texttt{direction} arguments, setting \texttt{direction} to \texttt{"between"} (between the values) and \texttt{endpoints} to be those stored with name \texttt{percentile\_ci}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-281-1} \end{center}

You can see that 95\% of the data stored in the \texttt{stat} variable in \texttt{bootstrap\_distribution} falls between the two endpoints with 2.5\% to the left outside of the shading and 2.5\% to the right outside of the shading. The cut-off points that provide our range are shown with the darker lines.

\hypertarget{the-standard-error-method}{%
\subsection{The standard error method}\label{the-standard-error-method}}

If the bootstrap distribution is close to symmetric and bell-shaped, we can also use a shortcut formula for determining the lower and upper endpoints of the confidence interval. This is done by using the formula \(\bar{x} \pm (multiplier * SE),\) where \(\bar{x}\) is our original sample mean and \(SE\) stands for \textbf{standard error} and corresponds to the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution. The value of \(multiplier\) here is the appropriate percentile of the standard normal distribution.

These are automatically calculated when \texttt{level} is provided with \texttt{level\ =\ 0.95} being the default. (95\% of the values in a standard normal distribution fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, so \(multiplier = 1.96\) for \texttt{level\ =\ 0.95}, for example.) As mentioned, this formula assumes that the bootstrap distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped. This is often the case with bootstrap distributions, especially those in which the original distribution of the sample is not highly skewed.

\textbf{Definition: standard error}

The \emph{standard error} is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.

The variability of the sampling distribution may be approximated by the variability of the bootstrap distribution. Traditional theory-based methodologies for inference also have formulas for standard errors, assuming some conditions are met.

This \(\bar{x} \pm (multiplier * SE)\) formula is implemented in the \texttt{get\_ci()} function as shown with our pennies problem using the bootstrap distribution's variability as an approximation for the sampling distribution's variability. We'll see more on this approximation shortly.

Note that the center of the confidence interval (the \texttt{point\_estimate}) must be provided for the standard error confidence interval.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-284-1} \end{center}

We see that both methods produce nearly identical confidence intervals with the percentile method being \([20.97, 29.25]\) and the standard error method being \([20.97, 29.28]\).

\hypertarget{comparing-bootstrap-and-sampling-distributions}{%
\section{Comparing bootstrap and sampling distributions}\label{comparing-bootstrap-and-sampling-distributions}}

To help build up the idea of a confidence interval, we weren't completely honest in our initial discussion. The \texttt{pennies\_sample} data frame represents a sample from a larger number of pennies stored as \texttt{pennies} in the \texttt{moderndive} package. The \texttt{pennies} data frame (also in the \texttt{moderndive} package) contains 800 rows of data and two columns pertaining to the same variables as \texttt{pennies\_sample}. Let's begin by understanding some of the properties of the \texttt{age\_by\_2011} variable in the \texttt{pennies} data frame.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

We see that \texttt{pennies} is slightly right-skewed with the mean being pulled towards the upper outliers. Recall that \texttt{pennies\_sample} was more symmetric than \texttt{pennies}. In fact, it actually exhibited some left-skew as we compare the mean and median values.

\hypertarget{sampling-distribution}{%
\subsubsection*{Sampling distribution}\label{sampling-distribution}}


Let's assume that \texttt{pennies} represents our population of interest. We can then create a sampling distribution for the population mean age of pennies, denoted by the Greek letter \(\mu\), using the \texttt{rep\_sample\_n()} function seen in Chapter \ref{sampling}. First we will create 1000 samples from the \texttt{pennies} data frame.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When creating a sampling distribution, we do not replace the items when we create each sample. This is in contrast to the bootstrap distribution. It's important to remember that the sampling distribution is sampling \textbf{without} replacement from the population to better understand sample-to-sample variability, whereas the bootstrap distribution is sampling \textbf{with} replacement from our original sample to better understand potential sample-to-sample variability.

After sampling from \texttt{pennies} 1000 times, we next want to compute the mean age for each of the 1000 samples:

We can also examine the variability in this sampling distribution by calculating the standard deviation of the \texttt{stat} column. Remember that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is the \textbf{standard error}, frequently denoted as \texttt{se}.

\end{verbatim}

Since the bootstrap distribution is centered at the original sample mean, it doesn't necessarily provide a good estimate of the overall population mean \(\mu\). Let's calculate the mean of \texttt{age\_in\_2011} for the \texttt{pennies} data frame to see how it compares to the mean of the sampling distribution and the mean of the bootstrap distribution.

\begin{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  overall_mean
         <dbl>
1         21.2
\end{verbatim}

Notice that this value matches up well with the mean of the sampling distribution. This is actually an artifact of the Central Limit Theorem introduced in Chapter \ref{sampling}. The mean of the sampling distribution is expected to be the mean of the overall population.

The unfortunate fact though is that we don't know the population mean in nearly all circumstances. The motivation of presenting it here was to show that the theory behind the Central Limit Theorem works using the tools you've worked with so far using the \texttt{ggplot2}, \texttt{dplyr}, \texttt{moderndive}, and \texttt{infer} packages.

If we aren't able to use the sample mean as a good guess for the population mean, how should we best go about estimating what the population mean may be if we can only select samples from the population. We've now come full circle and can discuss the underpinnings of the confidence interval and ways to interpret it.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{interpreting-the-confidence-interval}{%
\section{Interpreting the confidence interval}\label{interpreting-the-confidence-interval}}

As shown above in Subsection \ref{percentile-method}, one range of plausible values for the population mean age of pennies in 2011, denoted by \(\mu\), is \([20.97, 29.25]\). Recall that this confidence interval is based on bootstrapping using \texttt{pennies\_sample}. Note that the mean of \texttt{pennies} (21.152) does fall in this confidence interval. If we had a different sample of size 40 and constructed a confidence interval using the same method, would we be guaranteed that it contained the population parameter value as well? Let's try it out:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pennies_sample2 <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{pennies }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{sample_n}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{size =} \DecValTok{40}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note the use of the \texttt{sample\_n()} function in the \texttt{dplyr} package here. This does the same thing as \texttt{rep\_sample\_n(reps\ =\ 1)} but omits the extra \texttt{replicate} column.

We next create an \texttt{infer} pipeline to generate a percentile-based 95\% confidence interval for \(\mu\):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{percentile_ci2 <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{pennies_sample2 }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{generate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{reps =} \DecValTok{1000}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{calculate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{stat =} \StringTok{"mean"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{get_ci}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Setting `type = "bootstrap"` in `generate()`.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}

  `2.5%` `97.5%`
   <dbl>   <dbl>
1   18.4    25.3
\end{verbatim}

This new confidence interval also contains the value of \(\mu\). Let's further investigate by repeating this process 100 times to get 100 different confidence intervals derived from 100 different samples of \texttt{pennies}. Each sample will have size of 40 just as the original sample. We will plot each of these confidence intervals as horizontal lines. We will also show a line corresponding to the known population value of 21.152 years.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-301-1} \end{center}

Of the 100 confidence intervals based on samples of size \(n = 40\), 96 of them captured the population mean \(\mu = 21.152\), whereas 4 of them did not include it. If we repeated this process of building confidence intervals more times with more samples, we'd expect 95\% of them to contain the population mean. In other words, the procedure we have used to generate confidence intervals is ``95\% reliable'' in that we can expect it to include the true population parameter 95\% of the time if the process is repeated.

To further accentuate this point, let's perform a similar procedure using 90\% confidence intervals instead. This time we will use the standard error method instead of the percentile method for computing the confidence intervals.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-302-1} \end{center}

Of the 100 confidence intervals based on samples of size \(n = 40\), 87 of them captured the population mean \(\mu = 21.152\), whereas 13 of them did not include it. Repeating this process for more samples would result in us getting closer and closer to 90\% of the confidence intervals including the true value. It is common to say while interpreting a confidence interval to be ``95\% confident'' or ``90\% confident'' that the true value falls within the range of the specified confidence interval. We will use this ``confident'' language throughout the rest of this chapter, but remember that it has more to do with a measure of reliability of the building process.

\hypertarget{back-to-our-pennies-example}{%
\subsubsection*{Back to our pennies example}\label{back-to-our-pennies-example}}


After this elaboration on what the level corresponds to in a confidence interval, let's conclude by providing an interpretation of the original confidence interval result we found in Subsection \ref{percentile-method}.

\textbf{Interpretation:} We are 95\% confident that the true mean age of pennies in circulation in 2011 is between 20.972 and 29.252 years. This level of confidence is based on the percentile-based method including the true mean 95\% of the time if many different samples (not just the one we used) were collected and confidence intervals were created.

Let's revisit our exercise of trying to estimate the proportion of red balls in the bowl from Chapter \ref{sampling}. We are now interested in determining a confidence interval for population parameter \(p\), the proportion of balls that are red out of the total \(N = 2400\) red and white balls.

We will use the first sample reported from Ilyas and Yohan in Subsection \ref{student-shovels} for our point estimate. They observed 21 red balls out of the 50 in their shovel. This data is stored in the \texttt{tactile\_shovel1} data frame in the \texttt{moderndive} package.

Next we want to calculate many different bootstrap samples and their corresponding bootstrap statistic (the proportion of red balls). We've done 1000 in the past, but let's go up to 10,000 now to better see the resulting distribution. Recall that this is done by including a \texttt{generate()} function call in the middle of our pipeline:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

This results in 50 rows for each of the 10,000 replicates. Lastly, we finish the infer pipeline by adding back in the \texttt{calculate()} step.

Let's \texttt{visualize()} what the resulting bootstrap distribution looks like as a histogram. We've adjusted the number of bins here as well to better see the resulting shape.

We are 95\% confident that the true proportion of red balls in the bowl is between 0.284 and 0.556. This level of confidence is based on the standard error-based method including the true proportion 95\% of the time if many different samples (not just the one we used) were collected and confidence intervals were created.

\hypertarget{theory-based-confidence-intervals}{%
\subsection{Theory-based confidence intervals}\label{theory-based-confidence-intervals}}

When the bootstrap distribution has the nice symmetric, bell shape that we saw in the red balls example above, we can also use a formula to quantify the standard error. This provides another way to compute a confidence interval, but is a little more tedious and mathematical. The steps are outlined below. We've also shown how we can use the confidence interval (CI) interpretation in this case as well to support your understanding of this tricky concept.

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{Procedure for building a theory-based CI for \(p\)}{Procedure for building a theory-based CI for p}}\label{procedure-for-building-a-theory-based-ci-for-p}}


To construct a theory-based confidence interval for \(p\), the unknown true population proportion we

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Collect a sample of size \(n\)
\item
  Compute \(\widehat{p}\)
\item
  Compute the standard error \[\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}\]
\item
  Compute the margin of error \[\text{MoE} = 1.96 \cdot \text{SE} =  1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}\]
\item
  Compute both end points of the confidence interval:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The lower end point \texttt{lower\_ci}: \[\widehat{p} - \text{MoE} = \widehat{p} - 1.96 \cdot \text{SE} = \widehat{p} - 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}\]
  \item
    The upper end point \texttt{upper\_ci}: \[\widehat{p} + \text{MoE} = \widehat{p} + 1.96 \cdot \text{SE} = \widehat{p} + 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}\]
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Alternatively, you can succinctly summarize a 95\% confidence interval for \(p\) using the \(\pm\) symbol:
\end{enumerate}

\[
\widehat{p} \pm \text{MoE} = \widehat{p} \pm 1.96 \cdot \text{SE} = \widehat{p} \pm 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}
\]

Let's plot:

\tightlist
\item
  These 33 confidence intervals for \(p\): from \texttt{lower\_ci} to \texttt{upper\_ci}

We see that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In 31 cases, the confidence intervals ``capture'' the true \(p = 900 / 2400 = 0.375\)
\item
  In 2 cases, the confidence intervals do not ``capture'' the true \(p = 900 / 2400 = 0.375\)
\end{itemize}

Thus, the confidence intervals capture the true proportion \$31 / 33 = 93.939\% of the time using this theory-based methodology.

Let's say however, we repeated the above 100 times, not tactilely, but virtually. Let's do this only 100 times instead of 1000 like we did before so that the results can fit on the screen. Again, the steps for compute a 95\% confidence interval for \(p\) are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Collect a sample of size \(n = 50\) as we did in Chapter \ref{sampling}
\item
  Compute \(\widehat{p}\): the sample proportion red of these \(n=50\) balls
\item
  Compute the standard error \(\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}\)
\item
  Compute the margin of error \(\text{MoE} = 1.96 \cdot \text{SE} = 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}\)
\item
  Compute both end points of the confidence interval:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{lower\_ci}: \(\widehat{p} - \text{MoE} = \widehat{p} - 1.96 \cdot \text{SE} = \widehat{p} - 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}\)
  \item
    \texttt{upper\_ci}: \(\widehat{p} + \text{MoE} = \widehat{p} + 1.96 \cdot \text{SE} = \widehat{p} +1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}\)
  \end{itemize}

\caption{100 confidence intervals based on 100 virtual samples of size n=50}\label{fig:virtual-conf-int}
\end{figure}

We see that of our 100 confidence intervals based on samples of size \(n=50\), 96 of them captured the true \(p = 900/2400\), whereas 4 of them missed. As we create more and more confidence intervals based on more and more samples, about 95\% of these intervals will capture. In other words our procedure is ``95\% reliable.''

Theoretical methods like this have largely been used in the past since we didn't have the computing power to perform the simulation-based methods such as bootstrapping. They are still commonly used though and if the normality assumptions are met, they can provide a nice option for finding confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests as we will see in Chapter \ref{hypothesis-testing}.

\section{Example: Comparing two proportions}\label{example-comparing-two-proportions}}

If you see someone else yawn, are you more likely to yawn? In an \href{http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/yawning-contagious/}{episode} of the show \emph{Mythbusters}, they tested the myth that yawning is contagious. The snippet from the show is available to view in the United States on the Discovery Network website \href{https://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/is-yawning-contagious}{here}. More information about the episode is also available on IMDb \href{https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0768479/}{here}.

Fifty adults who thought they were being considered for an appearance on the show were interviewed by a show recruiter (``confederate'') who either yawned or did not. Participants then sat by themselves in a large van and were asked to wait. While in the van, the Mythbusters watched via hidden camera to see if the unaware participants yawned. The data frame containing the results is available at \texttt{mythbusters\_yawn} in the \texttt{moderndive} package. Let's check it out.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  The participant ID is stored in the \texttt{subj} variable with values of 1 to 50.
\item
  The \texttt{group} variable is either \texttt{"seed"} for when a confederate was trying to influence the participant or \texttt{"control"} if a confederate did not interact with the participant.
\item
  The \texttt{yawn} variable is either \texttt{"yes"} if the participant yawned or \texttt{"no"} if the participant did not yawn.
\end{itemize}

We can use the \texttt{janitor} package to get a glimpse into this data in a table format:

\end{verbatim}

We are interested in comparing the proportion of those that yawned after seeing a seed versus those that yawned with no seed interaction. We'd like to see if the difference between these two proportions is significantly larger than 0. If so, we'd have evidence to support the claim that yawning is contagious based on this study.

In looking over this problem, we can make note of some important details to include in our \texttt{infer} pipeline:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We are calling a \texttt{success} having a \texttt{yawn} value of \texttt{"yes"}.
\item
  Our response variable will always correspond to the variable used in the \texttt{success} so the response variable is \texttt{yawn}.
\item
  The explanatory variable is the other variable of interest here: \texttt{group}.
\end{itemize}

To summarize, we are looking to see the examine the relationship between yawning and whether or not the participant saw a seed yawn or not.

Error: Statistic is based on a difference; specify the `order` in which to subtract the levels of the explanatory variable. `order = c("first", "second")` means `("first" - "second")`. Check `?calculate` for details.
\end{verbatim}

We see another error here. To further check to make sure that R knows exactly what we are after, we need to provide the \texttt{order} in which R should subtract these proportions of successes. As the error message states, we'll want to put \texttt{"seed"} first after \texttt{c()} and then \texttt{"control"}: \texttt{order\ =\ c("seed",\ "control")}. Our point estimate is thus calculated:

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

This value represents the proportion of those that yawned after seeing a seed yawn (0.2941) minus the proportion of those that yawned with not seeing a seed (0.25).

\hypertarget{bootstrap-distribution-2}{%
\subsection{Bootstrap distribution}\label{bootstrap-distribution-2}}

Our next step in building a confidence interval is to create a bootstrap distribution of statistics (differences in proportions of successes). We saw how it works with both a single variable in computing bootstrap means in Subsection \ref{bootstrap-process} and in computing bootstrap proportions in Section \ref{one-prop-ci}, but we haven't yet worked with bootstrapping involving multiple variables though.

In the \texttt{infer} package, bootstrapping with multiple variables means that each \textbf{row} is potentially resampled. Let's investigate this by looking at the first few rows of \texttt{mythbusters\_yawn}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(mythbusters_yawn)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 6 x 3
   subj group   yawn 
  <int> <chr>   <chr>
1     1 seed    yes  
2     2 control yes  
3     3 seed    no   
4     4 seed    yes  
5     5 seed    no   
6     6 control no   
\end{verbatim}

When we bootstrap this data, we are potentially pulling the subject's readings multiple times. Thus, we could see the entries of \texttt{"seed"} for \texttt{group} and \texttt{"no"} for \texttt{yawn} together in a new row in a bootstrap sample. This is further seen by exploring the \texttt{sample\_n()} function in \texttt{dplyr} on this smaller 6 row data frame comprised of \texttt{head(mythbusters\_yawn)}. The \texttt{sample\_n()} function can perform this bootstrapping procedure and is similar to the \texttt{rep\_sample\_n()} function in \texttt{infer}, except that it is not \texttt{rep}eated but rather only performs one sample with or without replacement.

We can see that in this bootstrap sample generated from the first six rows of \texttt{mythbusters\_yawn}, we have some rows repeated. The same is true when we perform the \texttt{generate()} step in \texttt{infer} as done below.

This distribution is roughly symmetric and bell-shaped but isn't quite there. Let's use the percentile-based method to compute a 95\% confidence interval for the true difference in the proportion of those that yawn with and without a seed presented. The arguments are explicitly listed here but remember they are the defaults and simply \texttt{get\_ci()} can be used.

\begin{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 2
  `2.5%` `97.5%`
   <dbl>   <dbl>
1 -0.219   0.293
\end{verbatim}

The confidence interval shown here includes the value of 0. We'll see in Chapter \ref{hypothesis-testing} further what this means in terms of this difference being statistically significant or not, but let's examine a bit here first. The range of plausible values for the difference in the proportion of that that yawned with and without a seed is between -0.219 and 0.293.

Therefore, we are not sure which proportion is larger. Some of the bootstrap statistics showed the proportion without a seed to be higher and others showed the proportion with a seed to be higher. If the confidence interval was entirely above zero, we would be relatively sure (about ``95\% confident'') that the seed group had a higher proportion of yawning than the control group.

Note that this all relates to the importance of denoting the \texttt{order} argument in the \texttt{calculate()} function. Since we specified \texttt{"seed"} and then \texttt{"control"} positive values for the statistic correspond to the \texttt{"seed"} proportion being higher, whereas negative values correspond to the \texttt{"control"} group being higher.

We, therefore, have evidence via this confidence interval suggesting that the conclusion from the Mythbusters show that ``yawning is contagious'' being ``confirmed'' is not statistically appropriate.

We saw some of the main concepts of hypothesis testing introduced in Chapters \ref{sampling} and \ref{confidence-intervals}. We will expand further on these ideas here and also provide a framework for understanding hypothesis tests in general. Instead of presenting you with lots of different formulas and scenarios, we hope to build a way to think about all hypothesis tests. You can then adapt to different scenarios as needed down the road when you encounter different statistical situations.

The same can be said for confidence intervals. There was one general framework that applies to all confidence intervals and we elaborated on this using the \texttt{infer} package pipeline in Chapter \ref{confidence-intervals}. The specifics may change slightly for each variation, but the important idea is to understand the general framework so that you can apply it to more specific problems. We believe that this approach is much better in the long-term than teaching you specific tests and confidence intervals rigorously. You can find fully-worked out examples for five common hypothesis tests and their corresponding confidence intervals in Appendix \ref{appendixB}.

We recommend that you carefully review these examples as they also cover how the general frameworks apply to traditional normal-based methodologies like the \(t\)-test and normal-theory confidence intervals. You'll see there that these methods are just approximations for the general computational frameworks, but require conditions to be met for their results to be valid. The general frameworks using randomization, simulation, and bootstrapping do not hold the same sorts of restrictions and further advance computational thinking, which is one big reason for their emphasis throughout this textbook.

\section{When inference is not needed}\label{when-inference-is-not-needed}}

Before we delve into hypothesis testing, it's good to remember that there are cases where you need not perform a rigorous statistical inference. An important and time-saving skill is to \textbf{ALWAYS} do exploratory data analysis using \texttt{dplyr} and \texttt{ggplot2} before thinking about running a hypothesis test. Let's look at such an example selecting a sample of flights traveling to Boston and to San Francisco from New York City in the \texttt{flights} data frame in the \texttt{nycflights13} package. (We will remove flights with missing data first using \texttt{na.omit} and then sample 100 flights going to each of the two airports.)

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bos_sfo <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{flights }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{na.omit}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(dest }\OperatorTok{%in%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"BOS"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"SFO"}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(dest) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{sample_n}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Suppose we were interested in seeing if the \texttt{air\_time} to SFO in San Francisco was statistically greater than the \texttt{air\_time} to BOS in Boston. As suggested, let's begin with some exploratory data analysis to get a sense for how the two variables of \texttt{air\_time} and \texttt{dest} relate for these two destination airports:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bos_sfo_summary <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{bos_sfo }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(dest) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{mean_time =} \KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(air_time),}
            \DataTypeTok{sd_time =} \KeywordTok{sd}\NormalTok{(air_time))}
\NormalTok{bos_sfo_summary}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 2 x 3
  dest  mean_time sd_time
  <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>
1 BOS        39.0    4.51
2 SFO       349.    18.7 
\end{verbatim}

Looking at these results, we can clearly see that SFO \texttt{air\_time} is much larger than BOS \texttt{air\_time}. The standard deviation is also extremely informative here.

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC10.1)} Could we make the same type of immediate conclusion that SFO had a statistically greater \texttt{air\_time} if, say, its corresponding standard deviation was 200 minutes? What about 100 minutes? Explain.

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

To further understand just how different the \texttt{air\_time} variable is for BOS and SFO, let's look at a boxplot:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ bos_sfo, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ dest, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ air_time)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_boxplot}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-340-1} \end{center}

Since there is no overlap at all, we can conclude that the \texttt{air\_time} for San Francisco flights is statistically greater (at any level of significance) than the \texttt{air\_time} for Boston flights. This is a clear example of not needing to do anything more than some simple exploratory data analysis with descriptive statistics and data visualization to get an appropriate inferential conclusion. This is one reason why you should \textbf{ALWAYS} investigate the sample data first using \texttt{dplyr} and \texttt{ggplot2} via exploratory data analysis.

As you get more and more practice with hypothesis testing, you'll be better able to determine in many cases whether or not the results will be statistically significant. There are circumstances where it is difficult to tell, but you should always try to make a guess FIRST about significance after you have completed your data exploration and before you actually begin the inferential techniques.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{ht-basics}{%
\section{Basics of hypothesis testing}\label{ht-basics}}

In a hypothesis test, we will use data from a sample to help us decide between two competing \emph{hypotheses} about a population. We make these hypotheses more concrete by specifying them in terms of at least one \emph{population parameter} of interest. We refer to the competing claims about the population as the \textbf{null hypothesis}, denoted by \(H_0\), and the \textbf{alternative (or research) hypothesis}, denoted by \(H_a\). The roles of these two hypotheses are NOT interchangeable.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The claim for which we seek significant evidence is assigned to the alternative hypothesis. The alternative is usually what the experimenter or researcher wants to establish or find evidence for.
\item
  Usually, the null hypothesis is a claim that there really is ``no effect'' or ``no difference.'' In many cases, the null hypothesis represents the status quo or that nothing interesting is happening.\\
\item
  We assess the strength of evidence by assuming the null hypothesis is true and determining how unlikely it would be to see sample results/statistics as extreme (or more extreme) as those in the original sample.
\end{itemize}

Hypothesis testing brings about many weird and incorrect notions in the scientific community and society at large. One reason for this is that statistics has traditionally been thought of as this magic box of algorithms and procedures to get to results and this has been readily apparent if you do a Google search of ``flowchart statistics hypothesis tests.'' There are so many different complex ways to determine which test is appropriate.

You'll see that we don't need to rely on these complicated series of assumptions and procedures to conduct a hypothesis test any longer. These methods were introduced in a time when computers weren't powerful. Your cellphone (in 2016) has more power than the computers that sent NASA astronauts to the moon after all. We'll see that ALL hypothesis tests can be broken down into the following framework given by Allen Downey \href{http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2016/06/there-is-still-only-one-test.html}{here}:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/ht} 

}

\caption{Hypothesis Testing Framework}\label{fig:htdowney}
\end{figure}

Before we hop into this framework, we will provide another way to think about hypothesis testing that may be useful.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{trial}{%
\section{Criminal trial analogy}\label{trial}}

We can think of hypothesis testing in the same context as a criminal trial in the United States. A criminal trial in the United States is a familiar situation in which a choice between two contradictory claims must be made.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The accuser of the crime must be judged either guilty or not guilty.
\item
  Under the U.S. system of justice, the individual on trial is initially presumed not guilty.
\item
  Only STRONG EVIDENCE to the contrary causes the not guilty claim to be rejected in favor of a guilty verdict.
\item
  The phrase ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' is often used to set the cutoff value for when enough evidence has been given to convict.
\end{enumerate}

Theoretically, we should never say ``The person is innocent.'' but instead ``There is not sufficient evidence to show that the person is guilty.''

Now let's compare that to how we look at a hypothesis test.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The decision about the population parameter(s) must be judged to follow one of two hypotheses.
\item
  We initially assume that \(H_0\) is true.
\item
  The null hypothesis \(H_0\) will be rejected (in favor of \(H_a\)) only if the sample evidence strongly suggests that \(H_0\) is false. If the sample does not provide such evidence, \(H_0\) will not be rejected.
\item
  The analogy to ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' in hypothesis testing is what is known as the \textbf{significance level}. This will be set before conducting the hypothesis test and is denoted as \(\alpha\). Common values for \(\alpha\) are 0.1, 0.01, and 0.05.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{two-possible-conclusions}{%
\subsection{Two possible conclusions}\label{two-possible-conclusions}}

Therefore, we have two possible conclusions with hypothesis testing:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Reject \(H_0\)\\
\item
  Fail to reject \(H_0\)
\end{itemize}

Gut instinct says that ``Fail to reject \(H_0\)'' should say ``Accept \(H_0\)'' but this technically is not correct. Accepting \(H_0\) is the same as saying that a person is innocent. We cannot show that a person is innocent; we can only say that there was not enough substantial evidence to find the person guilty.

When you run a hypothesis test, you are the jury of the trial. You decide whether there is enough evidence to convince yourself that \(H_a\) is true (``the person is guilty'') or that there was not enough evidence to convince yourself \(H_a\) is true (``the person is not guilty''). You must convince yourself (using statistical arguments) which hypothesis is the correct one given the sample information.

\textbf{Important note:} Therefore, DO NOT WRITE ``Accept \(H_0\)'' any time you conduct a hypothesis test. Instead write ``Fail to reject \(H_0\).''

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{types-of-errors-in-hypothesis-testing}{%
\section{Types of errors in hypothesis testing}\label{types-of-errors-in-hypothesis-testing}}

Unfortunately, just as a jury or a judge can make an incorrect decision in regards to a criminal trial by reaching the wrong verdict, there is some chance we will reach the wrong conclusion via a hypothesis test about a population parameter. As with criminal trials, this comes from the fact that we don't have complete information, but rather a sample from which to try to infer about a population.

The possible erroneous conclusions in a criminal trial are

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  an innocent person is convicted (found guilty) or
\item
  a guilty person is set free (found not guilty).
\end{itemize}

The possible errors in a hypothesis test are

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  rejecting \(H_0\) when in fact \(H_0\) is true (Type I Error) or
\item
  failing to reject \(H_0\) when in fact \(H_0\) is false (Type II Error).
\end{itemize}

The risk of error is the price researchers pay for basing an inference about a population on a sample. With any reasonable sample-based procedure, there is some chance that a Type I error will be made and some chance that a Type II error will occur.

To help understand the concepts of Type I error and Type II error, observe the following table:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/errors} 

}

\caption{Type I and Type II errors}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-341}
\end{figure}

If we are using sample data to make inferences about a parameter, we run the risk of making a mistake. Obviously, we want to minimize our chance of error; we want a small probability of drawing an incorrect conclusion.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The probability of a Type I Error occurring is denoted by \(\alpha\) and is called the \textbf{significance level} of a hypothesis test
\item
  The probability of a Type II Error is denoted by \(\beta\).
\end{itemize}

Formally, we can define \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) in regards to the table above, but for hypothesis tests instead of a criminal trial.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\alpha\) corresponds to the probability of rejecting \(H_0\) when, in fact, \(H_0\) is true.
\item
  \(\beta\) corresponds to the probability of failing to reject \(H_0\) when, in fact, \(H_0\) is false.
\end{itemize}

Ideally, we want \(\alpha = 0\) and \(\beta = 0\), meaning that the chance of making an error does not exist. When we have to use incomplete information (sample data), it is not possible to have both \(\alpha = 0\) and \(\beta = 0\). We will always have the possibility of at least one error existing when we use sample data.

Usually, what is done is that \(\alpha\) is set before the hypothesis test is conducted and then the evidence is judged against that significance level. Common values for \(\alpha\) are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10. If \(\alpha = 0.05\), we are using a testing procedure that, used over and over with different samples, rejects a TRUE null hypothesis five percent of the time.

So if we can set \(\alpha\) to be whatever we want, why choose 0.05 instead of 0.01 or even better 0.0000000000000001? Well, a small \(\alpha\) means the test procedure requires the evidence against \(H_0\) to be \textbf{very strong} before we can reject \(H_0\). This means we will almost never reject \(H_0\) if \(\alpha\) is very small. If we almost never reject \(H_0\), the probability of a Type II Error -- failing to reject \(H_0\) when we should -- will \emph{increase}! Thus, as \(\alpha\) decreases, \(\beta\) increases and as \(\alpha\) increases, \(\beta\) decreases. We, therefore, need to strike a balance in \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) and the common values for \(\alpha\) of 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10 usually lead to a nice balance.

The idea that sample results are more extreme than we would reasonably expect to see by random chance if the null hypothesis were true is the fundamental idea behind statistical hypothesis tests. If data at least as extreme would be very unlikely if the null hypothesis were true, we say the data are \textbf{statistically significant}. Statistically significant data provide convincing evidence against the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative, and allow us to generalize our sample results to the claim about the population.

\section{Hypothesis testing with infer}\label{hypothesis-testing-with-infer}}

The ``There is Only One Test'' diagram mentioned in Section \ref{ht-basics} was the inspiration for the \texttt{infer} pipeline that you saw for confidence intervals in Chapter \ref{confidence-intervals}. For hypothesis tests, we include one more verb into the pipeline: the \texttt{hypothesize()} verb. Its main argument is \texttt{null} which is either

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{"point"} for point hypotheses involving a single sample or
\item
  \texttt{"independence"} for testing for independence between two variables.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/flowcharts/infer/ht} \end{center}

We'll first explore the two variable case by comparing two means. Note the section headings here that refer to the ``There is Only One Test'' diagram. We will lay out the specifics for each problem using this framework and the \texttt{infer} pipeline together.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{example-comparing-two-means}{%

\hypertarget{randomizationpermutation}{%
\subsection{Randomization/permutation}\label{randomizationpermutation}}

We will now focus on building hypotheses looking at the difference between two population means in an example. We will denote population means using the Greek symbol \(\mu\) (pronounced ``mu''). Thus, we will be looking to see if one group ``out-performs'' another group. This is quite possibly the most common type of statistical inference and serves as a basis for many other types of analyses when comparing the relationship between two variables.

Our null hypothesis will be of the form \(H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2\), which can also be written as \(H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0\). Our alternative hypothesis will be of the form \(H_0: \mu_1 \star \mu_2\) (or \(H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \, \star \, 0\)) where \(\star\) = \(<\), \(\ne\), or \(>\) depending on the context of the problem. You needn't focus on these new symbols too much at this point. It will just be a shortcut way for us to describe our hypotheses.

As we saw in Chapter \ref{confidence-intervals}, bootstrapping is a valuable tool when conducting inferences based on one or two population variables. We will see that the process of \textbf{randomization} (also known as \textbf{permutation}) will be valuable in conducting tests comparing quantitative values from two groups.

\hypertarget{comparing-action-and-romance-movies}{%
\subsection{Comparing action and romance movies}\label{comparing-action-and-romance-movies}}

The \texttt{movies} dataset in the \texttt{ggplot2movies} package contains information on a large number of movies that have been rated by users of IMDB.com \citep{R-ggplot2movies}. We are interested in the question here of whether \texttt{Action} movies are rated higher on IMDB than \texttt{Romance} movies. We will first need to do a little bit of data wrangling using the ideas from Chapter \ref{wrangling} to get the data in the form that we would like:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{movies_trimmed <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{movies }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(title, year, rating, Action, Romance)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that \texttt{Action} and \texttt{Romance} are binary variables here. To remove any overlap of movies (and potential confusion) that are both \texttt{Action} and \texttt{Romance}, we will remove them from our \emph{population}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{movies_trimmed <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{movies_trimmed }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{!}\NormalTok{(Action }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{&}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{Romance }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We will now create a new variable called \texttt{genre} that specifies whether a movie in our \texttt{movies\_trimmed} data frame is an \texttt{"Action"} movie, a \texttt{"Romance"} movie, or \texttt{"Neither"}. We aren't really interested in the \texttt{"Neither"} category here so we will exclude those rows as well. Lastly, the \texttt{Action} and \texttt{Romance} columns are not needed anymore since they are encoded in the \texttt{genre} column.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{movies_trimmed <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{movies_trimmed }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{genre =} \KeywordTok{case_when}\NormalTok{(Action }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ "Action"}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{                           Romance }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ "Romance"}\NormalTok{,}
                           \OtherTok{TRUE} \OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ "Neither"}\NormalTok{)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(genre }\OperatorTok{!=}\StringTok{ "Neither"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{Action, }\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{Romance)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{case\_when} function is useful for assigning values in a new variable based on the values of another variable. The last step of \texttt{TRUE\ \textasciitilde{}\ "Neither"} is used when a particular movie is not set to either Action or Romance.

We are left with 8878 movies in our \emph{population} dataset that focuses on only \texttt{"Action"} and \texttt{"Romance"} movies.

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC10.6)} Why are the different genre variables stored as binary variables (1s and 0s) instead of just listing the \texttt{genre} as a column of values like ``Action'', ``Comedy'', etc.?

\textbf{(LC10.7)} What complications could come above with us excluding action romance movies? Should we question the results of our hypothesis test? Explain.

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

Let's now visualize the distributions of \texttt{rating} across both levels of \texttt{genre}. Think about what type(s) of plot is/are appropriate here before you proceed:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ movies_trimmed, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ genre, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ rating)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_boxplot}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{Rating vs genre in the population}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-349}
\end{figure}

We can see that the middle 50\% of ratings for \texttt{"Action"} movies is more spread out than that of \texttt{"Romance"} movies in the population. \texttt{"Romance"} has outliers at both the top and bottoms of the scale though. We are initially interested in comparing the mean \texttt{rating} across these two groups so a faceted histogram may also be useful:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ movies_trimmed, }\DataTypeTok{mapping =} \KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ rating)) }\OperatorTok{+}

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{facet_grid}\NormalTok{(genre }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{.)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/movie-hist-1} 

}

\caption{Faceted histogram of genre vs rating}\label{fig:movie-hist}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Important note:} Remember that we hardly ever have access to the population values as we do here. This example and the \texttt{nycflights13} dataset were used to create a common flow from chapter to chapter. In nearly all circumstances, we'll be needing to use only a sample of the population to try to infer conclusions about the unknown population parameter values. These examples do show a nice relationship between statistics (where data is usually small and more focused on experimental settings) and data science (where data is frequently large and collected without experimental conditions).

\hypertarget{sampling-rightarrow-randomization}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Sampling \(\rightarrow\) randomization}{Sampling \textbackslash{}rightarrow randomization}}\label{sampling-rightarrow-randomization}}

We can use hypothesis testing to investigate ways to determine, for example, whether a \textbf{treatment} has an effect over a \textbf{control} and other ways to statistically analyze if one group performs better than, worse than, or different than another. We are interested here in seeing how we can use a random sample of action movies and a random sample of romance movies from \texttt{movies} to determine if a statistical difference exists in the mean ratings of each group.

\begin{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC10.8)} Define the relevant parameters here in terms of the populations of movies.

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

Let's select a random sample of 34 action movies and a random sample of 34 romance movies. (The number 34 was chosen somewhat arbitrarily here.)

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Note} the addition of the \texttt{ungroup()} function here. This will be useful shortly in allowing us to permute the values of \texttt{rating} across \texttt{genre}. Our analysis does not work without this \texttt{ungroup()} function since the data stays grouped by the levels of \texttt{genre} without it.

We can now observe the distributions of our two sample ratings for both groups. Remember that these plots
should be rough approximations of our population distributions of movie ratings for \texttt{"Action"} and \texttt{"Romance"}
in our population of all movies in the \texttt{movies} data frame.

\textbf{(LC10.9)} What single value could we change to improve the approximation using the sample distribution on the population distribution?

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

Do we have reason to believe, based on the sample distributions of \texttt{rating} over the two groups of \texttt{genre}, that there is a significant difference between the mean \texttt{rating} for action movies compared to romance movies? It's hard to say just based on the plots. The boxplot does show that the median sample rating is higher for romance movies, but the histogram isn't as clear. The two groups have somewhat differently shaped distributions but they are both over similar values of \texttt{rating}. It's often useful to calculate the mean and standard deviation as well, conditioned on the two levels.

\begin{Shaded}

\textbf{(LC10.10)} Why did we not specify \texttt{na.rm\ =\ TRUE} here as we did in Chapter \ref{wrangling}?

\begin{learncheck}

\end{learncheck}

We see that the sample mean rating for romance movies, \(\bar{x}_{r}\), is greater than the similar measure for action movies, \(\bar{x}_a\). But is it statistically significantly greater (thus, leading us to conclude that the means are statistically different)? The standard deviation can provide some insight here but with these standard deviations being so similar it's still hard to say for sure.

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC10.11)} Why might the standard deviation provide some insight about the means being statistically different or not?

\hypertarget{model-of-h_0}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Model of \(H_0\)}{Model of H\_0}}\label{model-of-h_0}}

The hypotheses we specified can also be written in another form to better give us an idea of what we will be simulating to create our null distribution.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(H_0: \mu_r - \mu_a = 0\)
\item

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{test-statistic-delta}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Test statistic \(\delta\)}{Test statistic \textbackslash{}delta}}\label{test-statistic-delta}}

We are, therefore, interested in seeing whether the difference in the sample means, \(\bar{x}_r - \bar{x}_a\), is statistically different than 0. We can now come back to our \texttt{infer} pipeline for computing our observed statistic. Note the \texttt{order} argument that shows the mean value for \texttt{"Action"} being subtracted from the mean value of \texttt{"Romance"}.

Our goal next is to figure out a random process with which to simulate the null hypothesis being true. Recall that \(H_0: \mu_r - \mu_a = 0\) corresponds to us assuming that the population means are the same. We would like to assume this is true and perform a random process to \texttt{generate()} data in the model of the null hypothesis.

\hypertarget{simulated-data}{%
\subsection{Simulated data}\label{simulated-data}}

\textbf{Tactile simulation}

Here, with us assuming the two population means are equal (\(H_0: \mu_r - \mu_a = 0\)), we can look at this from a tactile point of view by using index cards. There are \(n_r = 34\) data elements corresponding to romance movies and \(n_a = 34\) for action movies. We can write the 34 ratings from our sample for romance movies on one set of 34 index cards and the 34 ratings for action movies on another set of 34 index cards. (Note that the sample sizes need not be the same.)

The next step is to put the two stacks of index cards together, creating a new set of 68 cards. If we assume that the two population means are equal, we are saying that there is no association between ratings and genre (romance vs action). We can use the index cards to create two \textbf{new} stacks for romance and action movies. Note that the \textbf{new} ``romance movie stack'' will likely have some of the original action movies in it and likewise for the ``action movie stack'' including some romance movies from our original set. Since we are assuming that each card is equally likely to have appeared in either one of the stacks this makes sense. First, we must shuffle all the cards thoroughly. After doing so, in this case with equal values of sample sizes, we split the deck in half.

We then calculate the new sample mean rating of the romance deck, and also the new sample mean rating of the action deck. This creates one simulation of the samples that were collected originally. We next want to calculate a statistic from these two samples. Instead of actually doing the calculation using index cards, we can use R as we have before to simulate this process. Let's do this just once and compare the results to what we see in \texttt{movies\_genre\_sample}.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Distribution of \(\delta\) under \(H_0\)}{Distribution of \textbackslash{}delta under H\_0}}\label{distribution-of-delta-under-h_0}}

The \texttt{generate()} step completes a permutation sending values of ratings to potentially different values of \texttt{genre} from which they originally came. It simulates a shuffling of the ratings between the two levels of \texttt{genre} just as we could have done with index cards. We can now proceed in a similar way to what we have done previously with bootstrapping by repeating this process many times to create simulated samples, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{generated_samples <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{movies_genre_sample }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{generate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{reps =} \DecValTok{5000}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

A \textbf{null distribution} of simulated differences in sample means is created with the specification of \texttt{stat\ =\ "diff\ in\ means"} for the \texttt{calculate()} step. The \textbf{null distribution} is similar to the bootstrap distribution we saw in Chapter \ref{confidence-intervals}, but remember that it consists of statistics generated assuming the null hypothesis is true.

We can now plot the distribution of these simulated differences in means:

\hypertarget{the-p-value}{%
\subsection{The p-value}\label{the-p-value}}

Remember that we are interested in seeing where our observed sample mean difference of 0.95 falls on this null/randomization distribution. We are interested in simply a difference here so ``more extreme'' corresponds to values in both tails on the distribution. Let's shade our null distribution to show a visual representation of our \(p\)-value:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{null_distribution_two_means }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{visualize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{obs_stat =}\NormalTok{ obs_diff, }\DataTypeTok{direction =} \StringTok{"both"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}

}

\caption{Shaded histogram to show p-value}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-367}
\end{figure}

Remember that the observed difference in means was 0.95. We have shaded red all values at or above that value and also shaded red those values at or below its negative value (since this is a two-tailed test). By giving \texttt{obs\_stat\ =\ obs\_diff} a vertical darker line is also shown at 0.95. To better estimate how large the \(p\)-value will be, we also increase the number of bins to 100 here from 20:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{null_distribution_two_means }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{visualize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{bins =} \DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{obs_stat =}\NormalTok{ obs_diff, }\DataTypeTok{direction =} \StringTok{"both"}\NormalTok{)}

}

\caption{Histogram with vertical lines corresponding to observed statistic}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-368}
\end{figure}

At this point, it is important to take a guess as to what the \(p\)-value may be. We can see that there are only a few permuted differences as extreme or more extreme than our observed effect (in both directions). Maybe we guess that this \(p\)-value is somewhere around 2\%, or maybe 3\%, but certainly not 30\% or more. Lastly, we calculate the \(p\)-value directly using \texttt{infer}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pvalue <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{null_distribution_two_means }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{get_pvalue}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{obs_stat =}\NormalTok{ obs_diff, }\DataTypeTok{direction =} \StringTok{"both"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{pvalue}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  p_value
    <dbl>
1   0.006
\end{verbatim}

We have around 0.6\% of values as extreme or more extreme than our observed statistic in both directions. Assuming we are using a 5\% significance level for \(\alpha\), we have evidence supporting the conclusion that the mean rating for romance movies is different from that of action movies. The next important idea is to better understand just how much higher of a mean rating can we expect the romance movies to have compared to that of action movies.

\hypertarget{corresponding-confidence-interval}{%
\subsection{Corresponding confidence interval}\label{corresponding-confidence-interval}}

One of the great things about the \texttt{infer} pipeline is that going between hypothesis tests and confidence intervals is incredibly simple. To create a null distribution, we ran

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{null_distribution_two_means <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{movies_genre_sample }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{specify}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{formula =}\NormalTok{ rating }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{genre) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To get the corresponding bootstrap distribution with which we can compute a confidence interval, we can just remove or comment out the \texttt{hypothesize()} step since we are no longer assuming the null hypothesis is true when we bootstrap:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{percentile_ci_two_means <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{movies_genre_sample }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

  `2.5%` `97.5%`
   <dbl>   <dbl>
1  0.333    1.59
\end{verbatim}

Thus, we can expect the true mean of Romance movies on IMDB to have a rating 0.333 to 1.593 points higher than that of Action movies. Remember that this is based on bootstrapping using \texttt{movies\_genre\_sample} as our original sample and the confidence interval process being 95\% reliable.

\hypertarget{summary-5}{%
\subsection{Summary}\label{summary-5}}

To review, these are the steps one would take whenever you'd like to do a hypothesis test comparing
values from the distributions of two groups:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Simulate many samples using a random process that matches the way
  the original data were collected and that \emph{assumes the null hypothesis is
  true}.
\item
  Collect the values of a sample statistic for each sample created using this random process to build
  a \emph{null distribution}.
\item
  Assess the significance of the \emph{original} sample by determining where
  its sample statistic lies in the null distribution.
\item
  If the proportion of values as extreme or more extreme than the observed statistic in the randomization
  distribution is smaller than the pre-determined significance level \(\alpha\), we reject \(H_0\). Otherwise,
  we fail to reject \(H_0\). (If no significance level is given, one can assume \(\alpha = 0.05\).)

\section{Building theory-based methods using computation}\label{theory-hypo}}

As a point of reference, we will now discuss the traditional theory-based way to conduct the hypothesis test for determining if there is a statistically significant difference in the sample mean rating of Action movies versus Romance movies. This method and ones like it work very well when the assumptions are met in order to run the test. They are based on probability models and distributions such as the normal and \(t\)-distributions.

These traditional methods have been used for many decades back to the time when researchers didn't have access to computers that could run 5000 simulations in a few seconds. They had to base their methods on probability theory instead. Many fields and researchers continue to use these methods and that is the biggest reason for their inclusion here. It's important to remember that a \(t\)-test or a \(z\)-test is really just an approximation of what you have seen in this chapter already using simulation and randomization. The focus here is on understanding how the shape of the \(t\)-curve comes about without digging big into the mathematical underpinnings.

\hypertarget{example-t-test-for-two-independent-samples}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Example: \(t\)-test for two independent samples}{Example: t-test for two independent samples}}\label{example-t-test-for-two-independent-samples}}

What is commonly done in statistics is the process of standardization. What this entails is calculating the mean and standard deviation of a variable. Then you subtract the mean from each value of your variable and divide by the standard deviation. The most common standardization is known as the \(z\)-score. The formula for a \(z\)-score is \[Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma},\] where \(x\) represent the value of a variable, \(\mu\) represents the mean of the variable, and \(\sigma\) represents the standard deviation of the variable. Thus, if your variable has 10 elements, each one has a corresponding \(z\)-score that gives how many standard deviations away that value is from its mean. \(z\)-scores are normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. They have the common, bell-shaped pattern seen below.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-373-1} \end{center}

Recall, that we hardly ever know the mean and standard deviation of the population of interest. This is almost always the case when considering the means of two independent groups. To help account for us not knowing the population parameter values, we can use the sample statistics instead, but this comes with a bit of a price in terms of complexity.

Another form of standardization occurs when we need to use the sample standard deviations as estimates for the unknown population standard deviations. This standardization is often called the \(t\)-score. For the two independent samples case like what we have for comparing action movies to romance movies, the formula is \[T =\dfrac{ (\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{ \sqrt{\dfrac{{s_1}^2}{n_1} + \dfrac{{s_2}^2}{n_2}}  }\]

There is a lot to try to unpack here.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\bar{x}_1\) is the sample mean response of the first group
\item
  \(\bar{x}_2\) is the sample mean response of the second group
\item
  \(\mu_1\) is the population mean response of the first group
\item
  \(\mu_2\) is the population mean response of the second group
\item
  \(s_1\) is the sample standard deviation of the response of the first group
\item
  \(s_2\) is the sample standard deviation of the response of the second group
\item
  \(n_1\) is the sample size of the first group
\item
  \(n_2\) is the sample size of the second group
\end{itemize}

Assuming that the null hypothesis is true (\(H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0\)), \(T\) is said to be distributed following a \(t\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the smaller value of \(n_1 - 1\) and \(n_2 - 1\). The ``degrees of freedom'' can be thought of measuring how different the \(t\) distribution will be as compared to a normal distribution. Small sample sizes lead to small degrees of freedom and, thus, \(t\) distributions that have more values in the tails of their distributions. Large sample sizes lead to large degrees of freedom and, thus, \(t\) distributions that closely align with the standard normal, bell-shaped curve.

So, assuming \(H_0\) is true, our formula simplifies a bit:

\[T =\dfrac{ \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{ \sqrt{\dfrac{{s_1}^2}{n_1} + \dfrac{{s_2}^2}{n_2}}  }.\]

We have already built an approximation for what we think the distribution of \(\delta = \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2\) looks like using randomization above. Recall this distribution:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ null_distribution_two_means, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ stat)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_histogram}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{color =} \StringTok{"white"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{bins =} \DecValTok{20}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-374-1} 

}

\caption{Simulated differences in means histogram}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-374}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{infer} package also includes some built-in theory-based statistics as well, so instead of going through the process of trying to transform the difference into a standardized form, we can just provide a different value for \texttt{stat} in \texttt{calculate()}. Recall the \texttt{generated\_samples} data frame created via:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{generated_samples <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{movies_genre_sample }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{specify}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{formula =}\NormalTok{ rating }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{genre) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{hypothesize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{null =} \StringTok{"independence"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{generate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{reps =} \DecValTok{5000}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can now created a null distribution of \(t\) statistics:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{null_distribution_t <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{generated_samples }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{calculate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{stat =} \StringTok{"t"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{order =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Romance"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Action"}\NormalTok{))}
\NormalTok{null_distribution_t }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{visualize}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-376-1} \end{center}

We see that the shape of this \texttt{stat\ =\ "t"} distribution is the same as that of \texttt{stat\ =\ "diff\ in\ means"}. The scale has changed though with the \(t\) values having less spread than the difference in means.

A traditional \(t\)-test doesn't look at this simulated distribution, but instead it looks at the \(t\)-curve with degrees of freedom equal to 62.029. We can overlay this distribution over the top of our permuted \(t\) statistics using the \texttt{method\ =\ "both"} setting in \texttt{visualize()}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{null_distribution_t }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{visualize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{method =} \StringTok{"both"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-377-1} \end{center}

We can see that the curve does a good job of approximating the randomization distribution here. (More on when to expect for this to be the case when we discuss conditions for the \(t\)-test in a bit.) To calculate the \(p\)-value in this case, we need to figure out how much of the total area under the \(t\)-curve is at our observed \(T\)-statistic or more, plus also adding the area under the curve at the negative value of the observed \(T\)-statistic or below. (Remember this is a two-tailed test so we are looking for a difference--values in the tails of either direction.) Just as we converted all of the simulated values to \(T\)-statistics, we must also do so for our observed effect \(\delta^*\):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{obs_t <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{movies_genre_sample }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{specify}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{formula =}\NormalTok{ rating }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{genre) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{calculate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{stat =} \StringTok{"t"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{order =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Romance"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Action"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

So graphically we are interested in finding the percentage of values that are at or above 2.945 or at or below -2.945.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{null_distribution_t }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{visualize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{method =} \StringTok{"both"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{obs_stat =}\NormalTok{ obs_t, }\DataTypeTok{direction =} \StringTok{"both"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-379-1} \end{center}

As we might have expected with this just being a standardization of the difference in means statistic that produced a small \(p\)-value, we also have a very small one here.

\hypertarget{conditions-for-t-test}{%
\subsection{Conditions for t-test}\label{conditions-for-t-test}}

The \texttt{infer} package does not automatically check conditions for the theoretical methods to work and this warning was given when we used \texttt{method\ =\ "both"}. In order for the results of the \(t\)-test to be valid, three conditions must be met:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Independent observations in both samples
\item
  Nearly normal populations OR large sample sizes (\(n \ge 30\))
\item
  Independently selected samples
\end{enumerate}

Condition 1: This is met since we sampled at random using R from our population.

Condition 2: Recall from Figure \ref{fig:movie-hist}, that we know how the populations are distributed. Both of them are close to normally distributed. If we are a little concerned about this assumption, we also do have samples of size larger than 30 (\(n_1 = n_2 = 34\)).

Condition 3: This is met since there is no natural pairing of a movie in the Action group to a movie in the Romance group.

Since all three conditions are met, we can be reasonably certain that the theory-based test will match the results of the randomization-based test using shuffling. Remember that theory-based tests can produce some incorrect results in these assumptions are not carefully checked. The only assumption for randomization and computational-based methods is that the sample is selected at random. They are our preference and we strongly believe they should be yours as well, but it's important to also see how the theory-based tests can be done and used as an approximation for the computational techniques until at least more researchers are using these techniques that utilize the power of computers.

\section{Simulation-based Inference for Regression}\label{simulation-based-inference-for-regression}}

We can also use the concept of permuting to determine the standard error of our null distribution and conduct a hypothesis test for a population slope. Let's go back to our example on teacher evaluations Chapters \ref{regression} and \ref{multiple-regression}. We'll begin in the basic regression setting to test to see if we have evidence that a statistically significant \emph{positive} relationship exists between teaching and beauty scores for the University of Texas professors. As we did in Chapter \ref{regression}, teaching \texttt{score} will act as our outcome variable and \texttt{bty\_avg} will be our explanatory variable. We will set up this hypothesis testing process as we have each before via the ``There is Only One Test'' diagram in Figure \ref{fig:htdowney} using the \texttt{infer} package.

\hypertarget{data-1}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data-1}}

Our data is stored in \texttt{evals} and we are focused on the measurements of the \texttt{score} and \texttt{bty\_avg} variables there. Note that we don't choose a subset of variables here since we will \texttt{specify()} the variables of interest using \texttt{infer}.

Our test statistic here is the sample slope coefficient that we denote with \(b_1\).

\hypertarget{observed-effect-delta-1}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Observed effect \(\delta^*\)}{Observed effect \textbackslash{}delta\^{}*}}\label{observed-effect-delta-1}}

We can use the \texttt{specify()\ \%\textgreater{}\%\ calculate()} shortcut here to determine the slope value seen in our observed data:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{slope_obs <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{evals }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{calculate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{stat =} \StringTok{"slope"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The calculated slope value from our observed sample is \(b_1 = 0.067\).

\hypertarget{model-of-h_0-1}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Model of \(H_0\)}{Model of H\_0}}\label{model-of-h_0-1}}

We are looking to see if a positive relationship exists so \(H_A: \beta_1 > 0\). Our null hypothesis is always in terms of equality so we have \(H_0: \beta_1 = 0\). In other words, when we assume the null hypothesis is true, we are assuming there is NOT a linear relationship between teaching and beauty scores for University of Texas professors.

\hypertarget{simulated-data-1}{%
\subsection{Simulated data}\label{simulated-data-1}}

Now to simulate the null hypothesis being true and recreating how our sample was created, we need to think about what it means for \(\beta_1\) to be zero. If \(\beta_1 = 0\), we said above that there is no relationship between the teaching and beauty scores. If there is no relationship, then any one of the teaching score values could have just as likely occurred with any of the other beauty score values instead of the one that it actually did fall with. We, therefore, have another example of permuting in our simulating of data under the null hypothesis.

\textbf{Tactile simulation}

We could use a deck of 926 note cards to create a tactile simulation of this permuting process. We would write the 463 different values of beauty scores on each of the 463 cards, one per card. We would then do the same thing for the 463 teaching scores putting them on one per card.

Next, we would lay out each of the 463 beauty score cards and we would shuffle the teaching score deck. Then, after shuffling the deck well, we would disperse the cards one per each one of the beauty score cards. We would then enter these new values in for teaching score and compute a sample slope based on this permuting. We could repeat this process many times, keeping track of our sample slope after each shuffle.

\hypertarget{distribution-of-delta-under-h_0-1}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Distribution of \(\delta\) under \(H_0\)}{Distribution of \textbackslash{}delta under H\_0}}\label{distribution-of-delta-under-h_0-1}}

We can build our null distribution in much the same way we did in Chapter \ref{hypothesis-testing} using the \texttt{generate()} and \texttt{calculate()} functions. Note also the addition of the \texttt{hypothesize()} function, which lets \texttt{generate()} know to perform the permuting instead of bootstrapping.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-388-1} \end{center}

In viewing the distribution above with shading to the right of our observed slope value of 0.067, we can see that we expect the p-value to be quite small. Let's calculate it next using a similar syntax to what was done with \texttt{visualize()}.

\hypertarget{the-p-value-1}{%
\subsection{The p-value}\label{the-p-value-1}}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1

Since 0.067 falls far to the right of this plot beyond where any of the histogram bins have data, we can say that we have a \(p\)-value of 0. We, thus, have evidence to reject the null hypothesis in support of there being a positive association between the beauty score and teaching score of University of Texas faculty members.

\hypertarget{bootstrapping-for-the-regression-slope}{%
\section{Bootstrapping for the regression slope}\label{bootstrapping-for-the-regression-slope}}

With the p-value calculated as 0 in the hypothesis test above, we can next determine just how strong of a positive slope value we might expect between the variables of teaching \texttt{score} and beauty score (\texttt{bty\_avg}) for University of Texas faculty. Recall the \texttt{infer} pipeline above to compute the null distribution. Recall that this assumes the null hypothesis is true that there is no relationship between teaching score and beauty score using the \texttt{hypothesize()} function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{null_slope_distn <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{evals }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{calculate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{stat =} \StringTok{"slope"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To further reinforce the process being done in the pipeline, we've added the \texttt{type} argument to \texttt{generate()}. This is automatically added based on the entries for \texttt{specify()} and \texttt{hypothesize()} but it provides a useful way to check to make sure \texttt{generate()} is created the samples in the desired way. In this case, we \texttt{permute}d the values of one variable across the values of the other 10,000 times and \texttt{calculate}d a \texttt{"slope"} coefficient for each of these 10,000 \texttt{generate}d samples.

If instead we'd like to get a range of plausible values for the true slope value, we can use the process of bootstrapping:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bootstrap_slope_distn <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{evals }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-394-1} \end{center}

Next we can use the \texttt{get\_ci()} function to determine the confidence interval. Let's do this in two different ways obtaining 99\% confidence intervals. Remember that these denote a range of plausible values for an unknown true population slope parameter regressing teaching score on beauty score.

\begin{Shaded}

With the bootstrap distribution being close to symmetric, it makes sense that the two resulting confidence intervals are similar.

\hypertarget{model1residuals}{%
\subsection{Residual analysis}\label{model1residuals}}

Recall the residuals can be thought of as the error or the ``lack-of-fit'' between the observed value \(y\) and the fitted value \(\widehat{y}\) on the blue regression line in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot4}. Ideally when we fit a regression model, we'd like there to be \emph{no systematic pattern} to these residuals. We'll be more specific as to what we mean by \emph{no systematic pattern} when we see Figure \ref{fig:numxplot7} below, but let's keep this notion imprecise for now. Investigating any such patterns is known as \emph{residual analysis} and is the theme of this section.

We'll perform our residual analysis in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Creating a scatterplot with the residuals on the \(y\)-axis and the original explanatory variable \(x\) on the \(x\)-axis.
\item
  Creating a histogram of the residuals, thereby showing the \emph{distribution} of the residuals.
\end{enumerate}

First, recall in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot5} above we created a scatterplot where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  on the vertical axis we had the teaching score \(y\),
\item
  on the horizontal axis we had the beauty score \(x\), and
\item
  the blue arrow represented the residual for one particular instructor.
\end{itemize}

Instead, in Figure \ref{fig:numxplot6} below, let's create a scatterplot where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  On the vertical axis we have the residual \(y-\widehat{y}\) instead
\item
  On the horizontal axis we have the beauty score \(x\) as before:
\end{itemize}

\caption{Plot of residuals over beauty score}\label{fig:numxplot6}
\end{figure}

You can think of Figure \ref{fig:numxplot6} as Figure \ref{fig:numxplot5} but with the blue line flattened out to \(y=0\). Does it seem like there is \emph{no systematic pattern} to the residuals? This question is rather qualitative and subjective in nature, thus different people may respond with different answers to the above question. However, it can be argued that there isn't a \emph{drastic} pattern in the residuals.

Let's now get a little more precise in our definition of \emph{no systematic pattern} in the residuals. Ideally, the residuals should behave \emph{randomly}. In addition,

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the residuals should be on average 0. In other words, sometimes the regression model will make a positive error in that \(y - \widehat{y} > 0\), sometimes the regression model will make a negative error in that \(y - \widehat{y} < 0\), but \emph{on average} the error is 0.
\item
  Further, the value and spread of the residuals should not depend on the value of \(x\).
\end{enumerate}

In Figure \ref{fig:numxplot7} below, we display some hypothetical examples where there are \emph{drastic} patterns to the residuals. In Example 1, the value of the residual seems to depend on \(x\): the residuals tend to be positive for small and large values of \(x\) in this range, whereas values of \(x\) more in the middle tend to have negative residuals. In Example 2, while the residuals seem to be on average 0 for each value of \(x\), the spread of the residuals varies for different values of \(x\); this situation is known as \emph{heteroskedasticity}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/numxplot7-1} 

}

\caption{Examples of less than ideal residual patterns}\label{fig:numxplot7}
\end{figure}

The second way to perform a residual analysis is to look at the histogram of the residuals:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(regression_points, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ residual)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_histogram}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{binwidth =} \FloatTok{0.25}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{color =} \StringTok{"white"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{labs}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =} \StringTok{"Residual"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/model1residualshist-1} 

}

\caption{Histogram of residuals}\label{fig:model1residualshist}
\end{figure}

This histogram seems to indicate that we have more positive residuals than negative. Since the residual \(y-\widehat{y}\) is positive when \(y > \widehat{y}\), it seems our fitted teaching score from the regression model tends to \emph{underestimate} the true teaching score. This histogram has a slight \emph{left-skew} in that there is a long tail on the left. Another way to say this is this data exhibits a \emph{negative skew}. Is this a problem? Again, there is a certain amount of subjectivity in the response. In the authors' opinion, while there is a slight skew/pattern to the residuals, it isn't a large concern. On the other hand, others might disagree with our assessment. Here are examples of an ideal and less than ideal pattern to the residuals when viewed in a histogram:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/numxplot9-1} 

}

\caption{Examples of ideal and less than ideal residual patterns}\label{fig:numxplot9}
\end{figure}

In fact, we'll see later on that we would like the residuals to be \emph{normally distributed} with
mean 0. In other words, be bell-shaped and centered at 0! While this requirement and residual analysis in general may seem to some of you as not being overly critical at this point, we'll see later after when we cover \emph{inference for regression} in Chapter \ref{inference-for-regression} that for the last five columns of the regression table from earlier (\texttt{std\ error}, \texttt{statistic}, \texttt{p\_value},\texttt{lower\_ci}, and \texttt{upper\_ci}) to have valid interpretations, the above three conditions should roughly hold.

\begin{learncheck}
\textbf{\emph{Learning check}}
\end{learncheck}

\textbf{(LC11.2)} Continuing with our regression using \texttt{age} as the explanatory variable and teaching \texttt{score} as the outcome variable, use the \texttt{get\_regression\_points()} function to get the observed values, fitted values, and residuals for all 463 instructors. Perform a residual analysis and look for any systematic patterns in the residuals. Ideally, there should be little to no pattern.

Recall our discussion on residuals from Section \ref{model1residuals} where our goal was to investigate whether or not there was a \emph{systematic pattern} to the residuals. Ideally since residuals can be thought of as error, there should be no such pattern. While there are many ways to do such residual analysis, we focused on two approaches based on visualizations.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A plot with residuals on the vertical axis and the predictor (in this case continent) on the horizontal axis
\item
  A histogram of all residuals
\end{enumerate}

First, let's plot the residuals versus continent in Figure \ref{fig:catxplot7}, but also let's plot all 142 points with a little horizontal random jitter by setting the \texttt{width\ =\ 0.1} parameter in \texttt{geom\_jitter()}:

\begin{Shaded}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/catxplot7-1}

\caption{Plot of residuals over continent}\label{fig:catxplot7}
\end{figure}

We observe

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  There seems to be a rough balance of both positive and negative residuals for all 5 continents.
\item
  However, there is one clear outlier in Asia, which has a residual with the largest deviation away from 0.
\end{enumerate}

Let's investigate the 5 countries in Asia with the shortest life expectancy:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gapminder2007 }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(continent }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ "Asia"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-410}Countries in Asia with shortest life expectancy}
\centering
\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont
\begin{tabular}{llrr}
\toprule
country & continent & lifeExp & gdpPercap\\
\midrule
Afghanistan & Asia & 43.8 & 975\\
Iraq & Asia & 59.5 & 4471\\
Cambodia & Asia & 59.7 & 1714\\
Myanmar & Asia & 62.1 & 944\\
Yemen, Rep. & Asia & 62.7 & 2281\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This was the earlier identified residual for Afghanistan of -26.9. Unfortunately
given recent geopolitical turmoil, individuals who live in Afghanistan and, in particular in 2007, have a
drastically lower life expectancy.

Second, let's look at a histogram of all 142 values of
residuals in Figure \ref{fig:catxplot8}. In this case, the residuals form a
rather nice bell-shape, although there are a couple of very low and very high
values at the tails. As we said previously, searching for patterns in residuals
can be somewhat subjective, but ideally we hope there are no ``drastic'' patterns.

Is there a pattern? Please keep in mind that these types of questions are somewhat subjective and different people will most likely have different answers. The focus should be on being able to justify the conclusions made.

Recall in Section \ref{model1residuals}, our first residual analysis plot investigated the presence of any systematic pattern in the residuals when we had a single numerical predictor: \texttt{bty\_age}.

In this case, there \textbf{does} appear to be a systematic pattern to the residuals. As the scatter of the residuals around the line \(y=0\) is definitely not consistent. This behavior of the residuals is further evidenced by the histogram of residuals in Figure \ref{fig:model3-residuals-hist}. We observe that the residuals have a slight right-skew (recall we say that data is right-skewed, or positively-skewed, if there is a tail to the right). Ideally, these residuals should be bell-shaped around a residual value of 0.

Another way to interpret this histogram is that since the residual is computed as \(y - \widehat{y}\) = \texttt{balance} - \texttt{balance\_hat}, we have some values where the fitted value \(\widehat{y}\) is very much lower than the observed value \(y\). In other words, we are underestimating certain credit card holders' balances by a very large amount.

\end{figure}

Let's get a refresher of what you've covered so far. You first got started with with data in Chapter \ref{getting-started}, where you learned about the difference between R and RStudio, started coding in R, started understanding what R packages are, and explored your first dataset: all domestic departure flights from a New York City airport in 2013. Then:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Data science}: You assembled your data science toolbox using \texttt{tidyverse} packages. In particular:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ch.\ref{viz}: Visualizing data via the \texttt{ggplot2} package.
  \item
    Ch.\ref{tidy}: Understanding the concept of ``tidy'' data as a standardized data input format for all packages in the \texttt{tidyverse}
  \item
    Ch.\ref{wrangling}: Wrangling data via the \texttt{dplyr} package.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Data modeling}: Using these data science tools and helper functions from the \texttt{moderndive} package, you started performing data modeling. In particular:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ch.\ref{regression}: Constructing basic regression models.
  \item
    Ch.\ref{multiple-regression}: Constructing multiple regression models.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Statistical inference}: Once again using your newly acquired data science tools, we unpacked statistical inference using the \texttt{infer} package. In particular:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ch.\ref{sampling}: Understanding the role that sampling variability plays in statistical inference using both tactile and virtual simulations of sampling from a ``bowl'' with an unknown proportion of red balls.
  \item
    Ch.\ref{confidence-intervals}: Building confidence intervals.
  \item
    Ch.\ref{hypothesis-testing}: Conducting hypothesis tests.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Data modeling revisited}: Armed with your new understanding of statistical inference, you revisited and reviewed the models you constructed in Ch.\ref{regression} \& Ch.\ref{multiple-regression}. In particular:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ch.\ref{inference-for-regression}: Interpreting both the statistical and practice significance of the results of the models.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

All this was our approach of guiding you through your first experiences of \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3127.pdf}{``thinking with data''}, an expression originally coined by Diane Lambert of Google. How the philosophy underlying this expression guided our mapping of the flowchart above was well put in the introduction to the \href{https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/}{``Practical Data Science for Stats''} collection of preprints focusing on the practical side of data science workflows and statistical analysis, curated by \href{https://twitter.com/jennybryan?lang=en}{Jennifer Bryan} and \href{https://twitter.com/hadleywickham?lang=en}{Hadley Wickham}:

\begin{quote}
There are many aspects of day-to-day analytical work that are almost absent from the conventional statistics literature and curriculum. And yet these activities account for a considerable share of the time and effort of data analysts and applied statisticians. The goal of this collection is to increase the visibility and adoption of modern data analytical workflows. We aim to facilitate the transfer of tools and frameworks between industry and academia, between software engineering and statistics and computer science, and across different domains.
\end{quote}

In other words, in order to be equipped to ``think with data'' in the 21st century, future analysts need preparation going through the entirety of the \href{http://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html}{``Data/Science Pipeline''} we also saw earlier and not just parts of it.

In Section \ref{seattle-house-prices}, we'll take you through full-pass of the ``Data/Science Pipeline'' where we'll analyze the sale price of houses in Seattle, WA, USA. In Section \ref{data-journalism}, we'll present you with examples of effective data storytelling, in particular the articles from the data journalism website \href{https://fivethirtyeight.com/}{FiveThirtyEight.com}, many of whose source datasets are accessible from the \texttt{fivethirtyeight} R package.

\section{Case study: Seattle house prices}\label{seattle-house-prices}}

\href{https://www.kaggle.com/}{Kaggle.com} is a machine learning and predictive modeling competition website that hosts datasets uploaded by companies, governmental organizations, and other individuals. One of their datasets is the \href{https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction}{House Sales in King County, USA} consisting of homes sold in between May 2014 and May 2015 in King County, Washington State, USA, which includes the greater Seattle metropolitan area. This \href{https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/}{CC0: Public Domain} licensed dataset is included in the \texttt{moderndive} package in the \texttt{house\_prices} data frame, which we'll refer to as the ``Seattle house prices'' dataset.

The dataset consists 21,613 houses and 21 variables describing these houses; for a full list of these variables see the help file by running \texttt{?house\_prices} in the console. In this case study, we'll create a model using multiple regression where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The outcome variable \(y\) is the sale \texttt{price} of houses
\item
  The two explanatory/predictor variables we'll use are :

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(x_1\): house size \texttt{sqft\_living}, as measured by square feet of living space, where 1 square foot is about 0.09 square meters.
  \item
    \(x_2\): house \texttt{condition}, a categorical variable with 5 levels where 1 indicates ``poor'' and 5 indicates ``excellent.''

\hypertarget{house-prices-EDA-I}{%
\subsection{Exploratory data analysis (EDA)}\label{house-prices-EDA-I}}

A crucial first step before any formal modeling is an exploratory data analysis, commonly abbreviated at EDA. Exploratory data analysis can give you a sense of your data, help identify issues with your data, bring to light any outliers, and help inform model construction. There are three basic approaches to EDA:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Most fundamentally, just looking at the raw data. For example using RStudio's \texttt{View()} spreadsheet viewer or the \texttt{glimpse()} function from the \texttt{dplyr} package
\item
  Creating visualizations like the ones using \texttt{ggplot2} from Chapter \ref{viz}
\item
  Computing summary statistics using the \texttt{dplyr} data wrangling tools from Chapter \ref{wrangling}
\end{enumerate}

First, let's look the raw data using \texttt{View()} and the \texttt{glimpse()} function. Explore the dataset. Which variables are numerical and which are categorical? For the categorical variables, what are their levels? Which do you think would useful variables to use in a model for house price? In this case study, we'll only consider the variables \texttt{price}, \texttt{sqft\_living}, and \texttt{condition}. An important thing to observe is that while the \texttt{condition} variable has values \texttt{1} through \texttt{5}, these are saved in R as \texttt{fct} factors i.e.~R's way of saving categorical variables. So you should think of these as the ``labels'' \texttt{1} through \texttt{5} and not the numerical values \texttt{1} through \texttt{5}.

\end{verbatim}

Let's now perform the second possible approach to EDA: creating visualizations. Since \texttt{price} and \texttt{sqft\_living} are numerical variables, an appropriate way to visualize of these variables' distributions would be using a histogram using a \texttt{geom\_histogram()} as seen in Section \ref{histograms}. However, since \texttt{condition} is categorical, a barplot using a \texttt{geom\_bar()} yields an appropriate visualization of its distribution. Recall from Section \ref{geombar} that since \texttt{condition} is not ``pre-counted'', we use a \texttt{geom\_bar()} and not a \texttt{geom\_col()}. In Figure \ref{fig:house-prices-viz}, we display all three of these visualizations at once.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/house-prices-viz-1} 

}

\caption{Exploratory visualizations of Seattle house prices data}\label{fig:house-prices-viz}
\end{figure}

We observe the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In the histogram for \texttt{price}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Since \texttt{e+06} means \(10^6\), or one million, we see that a majority of houses are less than 2 million dollars.
  \item
    The x-axis stretches out far to the right to 8 million dollars, even though there appear to be no houses.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In the histogram for size \texttt{sqft\_living}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Most houses appear to have less than 5000 square feet of living space. For comparison a standard American football field is about 57,600 square feet, where as a standard soccer AKA association football field is about 64,000 square feet.
  \item
    The x-axis exhibits the same stretched out behavior to the right as for \texttt{price}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Most houses are of \texttt{condition} 3, 4, or 5.
\end{enumerate}

In the case of \texttt{price}, why does the x-axis stretch so far to the right? It is because there are a very small number of houses with price closer to 8 million; these prices are outliers in this case. We say variable is ``right skewed'' as exhibited by the long right tail. This skew makes it difficult to compare prices of the less expensive houses as the more expensive houses dominate the scale of the x-axis. This is similarly the case for \texttt{sqft\_living}.

Let's now perform the third possible approach to EDA: computing summary statistics. In particular, let's compute 4 summary statistics using the \texttt{summarize()} data wrangling verb from Section \ref{summarize}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Two measures of center: the mean and median
\item
  Two measures of variability/spread: the standard deviation and interquartile-range (IQR = 3rd quartile - 1st quartile)
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{house_prices }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}
    \DataTypeTok{mean_price =} \KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(price),}
    \DataTypeTok{median_price =} \KeywordTok{median}\NormalTok{(price),}
    \DataTypeTok{sd_price =} \KeywordTok{sd}\NormalTok{(price),}
    \DataTypeTok{IQR_price =} \KeywordTok{IQR}\NormalTok{(price)}
\NormalTok{  )}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 4
  mean_price median_price sd_price IQR_price
       <dbl>        <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
1    540088.       450000  367127.    323050
\end{verbatim}

Observe the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The mean \texttt{price} of \$540,088 is larger than the median of \$450,000. This is because the small number of very expensive outlier houses prices are inflating the average, whereas since the median is the ``middle'' value, it is not as sensitive to such large values at the high end. This is why the news typically reports median house prices and not average house prices when describing the real estate market. We say here that the median more ``robust to outliers'' than the mean.
\item
  Similarly, while both the standard deviation and IQR are both measures of spread and variability, the IQR is more ``robust to outliers.''
\end{enumerate}

If you repeat the above \texttt{summarize()} for \texttt{sqft\_living}, you'll find a similar relationship between mean vs median and standard deviation vs IQR given its similar right-skewed nature. Is there anything we can do about this right-skew? Again, this could potentially be an issue because we'll have a harder time discriminating between houses at the lower end of \texttt{price} and \texttt{sqft\_living}, which might lead to a problem when modeling.

We can in fact address this issue by using a log base 10 transformation, which we cover next.

\hypertarget{log10-transformations}{%
\subsection{log10 transformations}\label{log10-transformations}}

At its simplest, \texttt{log10()} transformations returns base 10 \emph{logarithms}. For example, since \(1000 = 10^3\), \texttt{log10(1000)} returns \texttt{3}. To undo a log10-transformation, we raise 10 to this value. For example, to undo the previous log10-transformation and return the original value of 1000, we raise 10 to this value \(10^{3}\) by running \texttt{10\^{}(3)\ =\ 1000}. log-transformations allow us to focus on multiplicative changes instead of additive ones, thereby emphasizing changes in ``orders of magnitude.'' Let's illustrate this idea in Table \ref{tab:logten} with examples of prices of consumer goods in US dollars.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:logten}log10-transformed prices, orders of magnitude, and examples}
\centering
\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont
\begin{tabular}{lrll}
\toprule
Price & log10(Price) & Order of magnitude & Examples\\
\midrule
\$1 & 0 & Singles & Cups of coffee\\
\$10 & 1 & Tens & Books\\
\$100 & 2 & Hundreds & Mobile phones\\
\$1,000 & 3 & Thousands & High definition TV's\\
\$10,000 & 4 & Tens of thousands & Cars\\
\addlinespace
\$100,000 & 5 & Hundreds of thousands & Luxury cars \& houses\\
\$1,000,000 & 6 & Millions & Luxury houses\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Let's break this down:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  When purchasing a cup of coffee, we tend to think of prices ranging in single dollars e.g. \$2 or \$3. However when purchasing say mobile phones, we don't tend to think in prices in single dollars e.g. \$676 or \$757, but tend to round to the nearest unit of hundreds of dollars e.g. \$200 or \$500.
\item
  Let's say we want to know the log10-transformed value of \$76. Even if this would be hard to compute without a calculator, we know that its log10 value is between 1 and 2, since \$76 is between \$10 and \$100. In fact, \texttt{log10(76)} is 1.880814.
\item
  log10-transformations are \emph{monotonic}, meaning they preserve orderings. So if Price A is lower than Price B, then log10(Price A) will also be lower than log10(Price B).
\item
  Most importantly, increments of one in log10 correspond to multiplicative changes and not additive ones. For example, increasing from log10(Price) of 3 to 4 corresponds to a multiplicative increase by a factor of 10: \$100 to \$1000.
\end{enumerate}

Let's create new log10-transformed versions of the right-skewed variable \texttt{price} and \texttt{sqft\_living} using the \texttt{mutate()} function from Section \ref{mutate}, but we'll give the latter the name \texttt{log10\_size}, which is a little more succinct and descriptive a variable name.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

    \DataTypeTok{log10_size =} \KeywordTok{log10}\NormalTok{(sqft_living)}
\NormalTok{    )}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let's first display the before and after effects of this transformation on these variables for only the first 10 rows of \texttt{house\_prices}:

Observe in particular:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The house in the 6th row with \texttt{price} \$1,225,000, which is just above one million dollars. Since \(10^6\) is one million, its \texttt{log10\_price} is 6.09. Contrast this with all other houses with \texttt{log10\_price} less than 6.
\item
  Similarly, there is only one house with size \texttt{sqft\_living} less than 1000. Since \(1000 = 10^3\), its the lone house with \texttt{log10\_size} less than 3.
\end{itemize}

Let's now visualize the before and after effects of this transformation for \texttt{price} in Figure \ref{fig:log10-price-viz}.

Observe that after the transformation, the distribution is much less skewed, and in this case, more symmetric and bell-shaped, although this isn't always necessarily the case. Now you can now better discriminate between house prices at the lower end of the scale. Let's do the same for size where the before variable is \texttt{sqft\_living} and the after variable is \texttt{log10\_size}. Observe in Figure \ref{fig:log10-size-viz} that the log10-transformation has a similar effect of un-skewing the variable. Again, we emphasize that while in these two cases the resulting distributions are more symmetric and bell-shaped, this is not always necessarily the case.

Given the now un-skewed nature of \texttt{log10\_price} and \texttt{log10\_size}, we are going to revise our modeling structure:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We'll use a new outcome variable \(y\) \texttt{log10\_price} of houses
\item
  The two explanatory/predictor variables we'll use are:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(x_1\): A modified version of house size: \texttt{log10\_size}
  \item
    \(x_2\): House \texttt{condition} will remain unchanged
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{eda-part-ii}{%
\subsection{EDA Part II}\label{eda-part-ii}}

Let's continue our exploratory data analysis from Subsection \ref{house-prices-EDA-I} above. The earlier EDA you performed was \emph{univariate} in nature in that we only considered one variable at a time. The goal of modeling, however, is to explore relationships between variables. So we must \emph{jointly} consider the relationship between the outcome variable \texttt{log10\_price} and the explanatory/predictor variables \texttt{log10\_size} (numerical) and \texttt{condition} (categorical). We viewed such a modeling scenario in Section \ref{model4} using the \texttt{evals} dataset, where the outcome variable was teaching \texttt{score}, the numerical explanatory/predictor variable was instructor \texttt{age} and the categorical explanatory/predictor variable was (binary) \texttt{gender}.

We have two possible visual models. Either a parallel slopes model in Figure \ref{fig:house-price-parallel-slopes} where we have a different regression line for each of the 5 possible \texttt{condition} levels, each with a different intercept but the same slope:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/house-price-parallel-slopes-1} 

}

\caption{Parallel slopes model}\label{fig:house-price-parallel-slopes}
\end{figure}

Or an interaction model in Figure \ref{fig:house-price-interaction}, where we allow each regression line to not only have different intercepts, but different slopes as well:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(house_prices, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ log10_size, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ log10_price, }\DataTypeTok{col =}\NormalTok{ condition)) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{alpha =} \FloatTok{0.1}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/house-price-interaction-1}

\caption{Interaction model}\label{fig:house-price-interaction}
\end{figure}

In both cases, we see there is a positive relationship between house price and size, meaning as houses are larger, they tend to be more expensive. Furthermore, in both plots it seems that houses of condition 5 tend to be the most expensive for most house sizes as evidenced by the fact that the purple line is highest, followed by condition 4 and 3. As for condition 1 and 2, this pattern isn't as clear, as if you recall from the univariate barplot of \texttt{condition} in Figure \ref{fig:house-prices-viz} there are very few houses of condition 1 or 2. This reality is more apparent in an alternative visualization to Figure \ref{fig:house-price-interaction} displayed in Figure \ref{fig:house-price-interaction-2} that uses facets instead:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(house_prices, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ log10_size, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ log10_price, }\DataTypeTok{col =}\NormalTok{ condition)) }\OperatorTok{+}

\end{figure}

Which exploratory visualization of the interaction model is better, the one in Figure \ref{fig:house-price-interaction} or Figure \ref{fig:house-price-interaction-2}? There is no universal right answer, you need to make a choice depending on what you want to convey, and own it.

\hypertarget{house-prices-regression}{%
\subsection{Regression modeling}\label{house-prices-regression}}

For now let's focus on the latter, interaction model we've visualized in Figure \ref{fig:house-price-interaction-2} above. What are the 5 different slopes and intercepts for the condition = 1, condition = 2, \ldots{}, and condition = 5 lines in Figure \ref{fig:house-price-interaction-2}? To determine these, we first need the values from the regression table:

\end{verbatim}

Recall from Section \ref{model4interactiontable} on how to interpret the outputs where there exists an \emph{interaction term}, where in this case the ``baseline for comparison'' group for the categorical variable \texttt{condition} are the condition 1 houses. We'll write our answers as:

\[\widehat{\log10(\text{price})} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_{\text{size}} * \log10(\text{size})\]

for all five condition levels separately:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Condition 1: \(\widehat{\log10(\text{price})} = 3.33 + 0.69 * \log10(\text{size})\)
\item
  Condition 2: \(\widehat{\log10(\text{price})} = (3.33 + 0.047) + (0.69 - 0.024) * \log10(\text{size}) = 3.38 + 0.666 * \log10(\text{size})\)
\item
  Condition 3: \(\widehat{\log10(\text{price})} = (3.33 - 0.367) + (0.69 + 0.133) * \log10(\text{size}) = 2.96 + 0.823 * \log10(\text{size})\)
\item
  Condition 4: \(\widehat{\log10(\text{price})} = (3.33 - 0.398) + (0.69 + 0.146) * \log10(\text{size}) = 2.93 + 0.836 * \log10(\text{size})\)
\item
  Condition 5: \(\widehat{\log10(\text{price})} = (3.33 - 0.883) + (0.69 + 0.31) * \log10(\text{size}) = 2.45 + 1 * \log10(\text{size})\)
\end{enumerate}

These correspond to the regression lines in the exploratory visualization of the interaction model in Figure \ref{fig:house-price-interaction} above. For homes of all 5 condition types, as the size of the house increases, the prices increases. This is what most would expect. However, the rate of increase of price with size is fastest for the homes with condition 3, 4, and 5 of 0.823, 0.836, and 1 respectively; these are the 3 most largest slopes out of the 5.

\hypertarget{house-prices-making-predictions}{%
\subsection{Making predictions}\label{house-prices-making-predictions}}

Say you're a realtor and someone calls you asking you how much their home will sell for. They tell you that it's in condition = 5 and is sized 1900 square feet. What do you tell them? We first make this prediction visually in Figure \ref{fig:house-price-interaction-3}. The predicted \texttt{log10\_price} of this house is marked with a black dot: it is where the two following lines intersect:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The purple regression line for the condition = 5 homes and
\item
  The vertical dashed black line at \texttt{log10\_size} equals 3.28, since our predictor variable is the log10-transformed square feet of living space and \(\log10(1900) = 3.28\) .
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/house-price-interaction-3-1} 

}

\caption{Interaction model with prediction}\label{fig:house-price-interaction-3}
\end{figure}

Eyeballing it, it seems the predicted \texttt{log10\_price} seems to be around 5.72. Let's now obtain the an exact numerical value for the prediction using the values of the intercept and slope for the condition = 5 that we computed using the regression table output. We use the equation for the condition = 5 line, being sure to \texttt{log10()} the
square footage first.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 5.73
\end{verbatim}

This value is very close to our earlier visually made prediction of 5.72. But wait! We were using the outcome variable \texttt{log10\_price} as our outcome variable! So if we want a prediction in terms of \texttt{price} in dollar units, we need to un-log this by taking a power of 10 as described in Section \ref{log10-transformations}.

As we've progressed throughout this book, you've seen how to work with data in a variety of ways. You've learned effective strategies for plotting data by understanding which types of plots work best for which combinations of variable types. You've summarized data in table form and calculated summary statistics for a variety of different variables. Further, you've seen the value of inference as a process to come to conclusions about a population by using a random sample. Lastly, you've explored how to use linear regression and the importance of checking the conditions required to make it a valid procedure. All throughout, you've learned many computational techniques and focused on reproducible research in writing R code. We now present another case study, but this time of the ``effective data storytelling'' done by data journalists around the world. Great data stories don't mislead the reader, but rather engulf them in understanding the importance that data plays in our lives through the captivation of storytelling.

The \texttt{fivethirtyeight} package takes FiveThirtyEight's article data from GitHub, \href{http://rpubs.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight_tamedata}{``tames''} it so that it's novice-friendly, and makes all data, documentation, and the original article easily accessible via an R package.

For more information on this data frame including a link to the original article on FiveThirtyEight.com, check out the help file by running \texttt{?US\_births\_1994\_2003} in the console.

We'll focus on the number of \texttt{births} for each \texttt{date}, but only for births that occurred in 1999. Recall we achieve this using the \texttt{filter()} command from \texttt{dplyr} package:

Since \texttt{date} is a notion of time, which has a sequential ordering to it, a linegraph AKA a ``time series'' plot would be more appropriate than a scatterplot. In other words, use a \texttt{geom\_line()} instead of \texttt{geom\_point()}:

You've also gained a lot of knowledge about how to use simulation techniques to determine statistical significance and how these techniques build an intuition about traditional inferential methods like the \(t\)-test. The hope is that you've come to appreciate data wrangling, tidy datasets, and the power of data visualization. Actually, the data visualization part may be the most important thing here. If you can create truly beautiful graphics that display information in ways that the reader can clearly decipher, you've picked up a great skill. Let's hope that that skill keeps you creating great stories with data into the near and far distant future. Thanks for coming along for the ride as we dove into modern data analysis using R!

\hypertarget{basic-statistical-terms}{%
\section{Basic statistical terms}\label{basic-statistical-terms}}

\hypertarget{mean}{%
\subsection{Mean}\label{mean}}

The mean AKA average is the most commonly reported measure of center. It is commonly called the ``average'' though this term can be a little ambiguous. The mean is the sum of all of the data elements divided by how many elements there are. If we have \(n\) data points, the mean is given by: \[Mean = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n}\]

\hypertarget{median}{%
\subsection{Median}\label{median}}

The median is calculated by first sorting a variable's data from smallest to largest. After sorting the data, the middle element in the list is the \textbf{median}. If the middle falls between two values, then the median is the mean of those two values.

\hypertarget{standard-deviation}{%
\subsection{Standard deviation}\label{standard-deviation}}

We will next discuss the \textbf{standard deviation} of a sample dataset pertaining to one variable. The formula can be a little intimidating at first but it is important to remember that it is essentially a measure of how far to expect a given data value is from its mean:

\[Standard \, deviation = \sqrt{\frac{(x_1 - Mean)^2 + (x_2 - Mean)^2 + \cdots + (x_n - Mean)^2}{n - 1}}\]

\hypertarget{five-number-summary}{%
\subsection{Five-number summary}\label{five-number-summary}}

The \textbf{five-number summary} consists of five values: minimum, first quantile AKA 25\textsuperscript{th} percentile, second quantile AKA median AKA 50\textsuperscript{th} percentile, third quantile AKA 75\textsuperscript{th}, and maximum. The quantiles are calculated as

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  first quantile (\(Q_1\)): the median of the first half of the sorted data
\item
  third quantile (\(Q_3\)): the median of the second half of the sorted data
\end{itemize}

The \emph{interquartile range} is defined as \(Q_3 - Q_1\) and is a measure of how spread out the middle 50\% of values is. The five-number summary is not influenced by the presence of outliers in the ways that the mean and standard deviation are. It is, thus, recommended for skewed datasets.

\hypertarget{distribution}{%
\subsection{Distribution}\label{distribution}}

The \textbf{distribution} of a variable/dataset corresponds to generalizing patterns in the dataset. It often shows how frequently elements in the dataset appear. It shows how the data varies and gives some information about where a typical element in the data might fall. Distributions are most easily seen through data visualization.

\hypertarget{outliers}{%
\subsection{Outliers}\label{outliers}}

\textbf{Outliers} correspond to values in the dataset that fall far outside the range of ``ordinary'' values. In regards to a boxplot (by default), they correspond to values below \(Q_1 - (1.5 * IQR)\) or above \(Q_3 + (1.5 * IQR)\).

Note that these terms (aside from \textbf{Distribution}) only apply to quantitative variables.

The National Survey of Family Growth conducted by the
Centers for Disease Control gathers information on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy,
infertility, use of contraception, and men's and women's health. One of the variables collected on
this survey is the age at first marriage. 5,534 randomly sampled US women between 2006 and 2010 completed the survey. The women sampled here had been married at least once. Do we have evidence that the mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is greater than 23 years? \citep[Tweaked a bit from][ {[}Chapter 4{]}]{isrs2014}

We are looking to see if the observed sample mean of 23.44 is statistically greater than \(\mu_0 = 23\). They seem to be quite close, but we have a large sample size here. Let's guess that the large sample size will lead us to reject this practically small difference.

In order to look to see if the observed sample mean of 23.44 is statistically greater than \(\mu_0 = 23\), we need to account for the sample size. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original sample of size 5534 was selected.

We can use the idea of \emph{bootstrapping} to simulate the population from which the sample came and then generate samples from that simulated population to account for sampling variability. Recall how bootstrapping would apply in this context:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Sample with replacement from our original sample of 5534 women and repeat this process 10,000 times,
\item
  calculate the mean for each of the 10,000 bootstrap samples created in Step 1.,
\item
  combine all of these bootstrap statistics calculated in Step 2 into a \texttt{boot\_distn} object, and
\item
  shift the center of this distribution over to the null value of 23. (This is needed since it will be centered at 23.44 via the process of bootstrapping.)

We can next use this distribution to observe our \(p\)-value. Recall this is a right-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are greater than or equal to 23.44 for our \(p\)-value.

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1

So our \(p\)-value is 0 and we reject the null hypothesis at the 5\% level. You can also see this from the histogram above that we are far into the tail of the null distribution.

\hypertarget{bootstrapping-for-confidence-interval}{%
\subsubsection*{Bootstrapping for confidence interval}\label{bootstrapping-for-confidence-interval}}


We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \(\mu\) using our sample data using \emph{bootstrapping}. Note that we don't need to shift this distribution since we want the center of our confidence interval to be our point estimate \(\bar{x}_{obs} = 23.44\).

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-454-1} \end{center}

We see that 23 is not contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \(\mu\) (the unknown population mean) and the entire interval is larger than 23. This matches with our hypothesis test results of rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative (\(\mu > 23\)).

\textbf{Interpretation}: We are 95\% confident the true mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is between 23.316 and 23.565.

\hypertarget{check-conditions}{%
\subsubsection*{Check conditions}\label{check-conditions}}


Remember that in order to use the shortcut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Independent observations}: The observations are collected independently.

  The cases are selected independently through random sampling so this condition is met.
\item
  \emph{Approximately normal}: The distribution of the response variable should be normal or the sample size should be at least 30.

  The histogram for the sample above does show some skew.
\end{enumerate}

The Q-Q plot below also shows some skew.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/qqplotmean-1} \end{center}

The sample size here is quite large though (\(n = 5534\)) so both conditions are met.

\hypertarget{test-statistic}{%
\subsubsection*{Test statistic}\label{test-statistic}}


The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we want to look at a way to estimate the population mean \(\mu\). A good guess is the sample mean \(\bar{X}\). Recall that this sample mean is actually a random variable that will vary as different samples are (theoretically, would be) collected. We are looking to see how likely is it for us to have observed a sample mean of \(\bar{x}_{obs} = 23.44\) or larger assuming that the population mean is 23 (assuming the null hypothesis is true). If the conditions are met and assuming \(H_0\) is true, we can ``standardize'' this original test statistic of \(\bar{X}\) into a \(T\) statistic that follows a \(t\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \(df = n - 1\):

\[ T =\dfrac{ \bar{X} - \mu_0}{ S / \sqrt{n} } \sim t (df = n - 1) \]

where \(S\) represents the standard deviation of the sample and \(n\) is the sample size.

\hypertarget{observed-test-statistic}{%
\paragraph{Observed test statistic}\label{observed-test-statistic}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Observed test statistic}

While one could compute this observed test statistic by ``hand'', the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. We can use the \texttt{t\_test()} function to perform this analysis for us.

\end{verbatim}

We see here that the \(t_{obs}\) value is 6.936.

\hypertarget{compute-p-value}{%
\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{Compute \(p\)-value}{Compute p-value}}\label{compute-p-value}}


The \(p\)-value---the probability of observing an \(t_{obs}\) value of 6.936 or more in our null distribution of a \(t\) with 5533 degrees of freedom---is essentially 0.

\hypertarget{state-conclusion}{%
\subsubsection*{State conclusion}\label{state-conclusion}}


We, therefore, have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that our observed sample mean was statistically greater than the hypothesized mean has supporting evidence here. Based on this sample, we have evidence that the mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is greater than 23 years.

Observing the bootstrap distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \(p\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions also being met (the large sample size was the driver here) leads us to better guess that using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) will lead to similar results.

We are looking to see if the sample proportion of 0.73 is statistically different from \(p_0 = 0.8\) based on this sample. They seem to be quite close, and our sample size is not huge here (\(n = 100\)). Let's guess that we do not have evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

In order to look to see if 0.73 is statistically different from 0.8, we need to account for the sample size. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original sample of size 100 was selected. We can use the idea of an unfair coin to \emph{simulate} this process. We will simulate flipping an unfair coin (with probability of success 0.8 matching the null hypothesis) 100 times. Then we will keep track of how many heads come up in those 100 flips. Our simulated statistic matches with how we calculated the original statistic \(\hat{p}\): the number of heads (satisfied) out of our total sample of 100. We then repeat this process many times (say 10,000) to create the null distribution looking at the simulated proportions of successes:

\item
  sampling with replacement from our original sample of 100 survey respondents and repeating this process 10,000 times,
\item
  calculating the proportion of successes for each of the 10,000 bootstrap samples created in Step 1.,
\item
  combining all of these bootstrap statistics calculated in Step 2 into a \texttt{boot\_distn} object,
\item
  identifying the 2.5\textsuperscript{th} and 97.5\textsuperscript{th} percentiles of this distribution (corresponding to the 5\% significance level chosen) to find a 95\% confidence interval for \(\pi\), and
\item

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  \emph{Independent observations}: The observations are collected independently.

  The cases are selected independently through random sampling so this condition is met.

The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we want to look at a way to estimate the population proportion \(\pi\). A good guess is the sample proportion \(\hat{P}\). Recall that this sample proportion is actually a random variable that will vary as different samples are (theoretically, would be) collected. We are looking to see how likely is it for us to have observed a sample proportion of \(\hat{p}_{obs} = 0.73\) or larger assuming that the population proportion is 0.80 (assuming the null hypothesis is true). If the conditions are met and assuming \(H_0\) is true, we can standardize this original test statistic of \(\hat{P}\) into a \(Z\) statistic that follows a \(N(0, 1)\) distribution.

\[ Z =\dfrac{ \hat{P} - p_0}{\sqrt{\dfrac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n} }} \sim N(0, 1) \]

We, therefore, do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Based on this sample, we have do not evidence that the proportion of all customers of the large electric utility satisfied with service they receive is different from 0.80, at the 5\% level.

Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \(p\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions also being met leads us to better guess that using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) will lead to similar results.

We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original group sizes of 389 and 438 were selected.

We can use the idea of \emph{randomization testing} (also known as \emph{permutation testing}) to simulate the population from which the sample came (with two groups of different sizes) and then generate samples using \emph{shuffling} from that simulated population to account for sampling variability.

This matches with our hypothesis test results of rejecting the null hypothesis. Since zero is not a plausible value of the population parameter, we have evidence that the proportion of college graduates in California with no opinion on drilling is different than that of non-college graduates.

\textbf{Interpretation}: We are 95\% confident the true proportion of non-college graduates with no opinion on offshore drilling in California is between 0.16 dollars smaller to 0.04 dollars smaller than for college graduates.

Remember that in order to use the short-cut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Independent observations}: Each case that was selected must be independent of all the other cases selected.

  This condition is met since cases were selected at random to observe.
\item
  \emph{Sample size}: The number of pooled successes and pooled failures must be at least 10 for each group.

  We need to first figure out the pooled success rate: \[\hat{p}_{obs} = \dfrac{131 + 104}{827} = 0.28.\] We now determine expected (pooled) success and failure counts:

  \(0.28 \cdot (131 + 258) = 108.92\), \(0.72 \cdot (131 + 258) = 280.08\)

  \(0.28 \cdot (104 + 334) = 122.64\), \(0.72 \cdot (104 + 334) = 315.36\)
\item
  \emph{Independent selection of samples}: The cases are not paired in any meaningful way.

  We have no reason to suspect that a college graduate selected would have any relationship to a non-college graduate selected.

The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we are interested in seeing if our observed difference in sample proportions corresponding to no opinion on drilling (\(\hat{p}_{college, obs} - \hat{p}_{no\_college, obs}\) = 0.033) is statistically different than 0. Assuming that conditions are met and the null hypothesis is true, we can use the standard normal distribution to standardize the difference in sample proportions (\(\hat{P}_{college} - \hat{P}_{no\_college}\)) using the standard error of \(\hat{P}_{college} - \hat{P}_{no\_college}\) and the pooled estimate:

\[ Z =\dfrac{ (\hat{P}_1 - \hat{P}_2) - 0}{\sqrt{\dfrac{\hat{P}(1 - \hat{P})}{n_1} + \dfrac{\hat{P}(1 - \hat{P})}{n_2} }} \sim N(0, 1) \] where \(\hat{P} = \dfrac{\text{total number of successes} }{ \text{total number of cases}}.\)

Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \(p\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions were not met since the number of pairs was small, but the sample data was not highly skewed. Using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) lead to similar results.

Average income varies from one region of the country to

is considering a job in two locations, Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA, and he wants to see
whether the average income in one of these cities is higher than the other. He would like to conduct
a hypothesis test based on two randomly selected samples from the 2000 Census. \citep[Tweaked a bit from][ {[}Chapter 5{]}]{isrs2014}

In order to look to see if the observed sample mean for Sacramento of 27467.066 is statistically different than that for Cleveland of 32427.543, we need to account for the sample sizes. Note that this is the same as looking to see if \(\bar{x}_{sac} - \bar{x}_{cle}\) is statistically different than 0. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the original group sizes of 212 and 175 were selected.

We can use the idea of \emph{randomization testing} (also known as \emph{permutation testing}) to simulate the population from which the sample came (with two groups of different sizes) and then generate samples using \emph{shuffling} from that simulated population to account for sampling variability.

We see that 0 is contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \(\mu_{sac} - \mu_{cle}\) (the unknown population parameter). This matches with our hypothesis test results of failing to reject the null hypothesis. Since zero is a plausible value of the population parameter, we do not have evidence that Sacramento incomes are different than Cleveland incomes.

\textbf{Interpretation}: We are 95\% confident the true mean yearly income for those living in Sacramento is between 1445.53 dollars smaller to 11307.82 dollars higher than for Cleveland.

\textbf{Note}: You could also use the null distribution based on randomization with a shift to have its center at \(\bar{x}_{sac} - \bar{x}_{cle} = \$4960.48\) instead of at 0 and calculate its percentiles. The confidence interval produced via this method should be comparable to the one done using bootstrapping above.

Do the data suggest that the true average concentration in the surface water is smaller than that of bottom water? (Note that units are not given.) {[}Tweaked a bit from \url{https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat500/node/51}{]}

In order to look to see if the observed sample mean difference \(\bar{x}_{diff} = 4960.477\) is statistically less than 0, we need to account for the number of pairs. We also need to determine a process that replicates how the paired data was selected in a way similar to how we calculated our original difference in sample means.

Treating the differences as our data of interest, we next use the process of \textbf{bootstrapping} to build other simulated samples and then calculate the mean of the bootstrap samples. We hypothesize that the mean difference is zero.

This process is similar to comparing the One Mean example seen above, but using the differences between the two groups as a single sample with a hypothesized mean difference of 0.

We can next use this distribution to observe our \(p\)-value. Recall this is a left-tailed test so we will be looking for values that are less than or equal to 4960.477 for our \(p\)-value.

So our \(p\)-value is essentially 0 and we reject the null hypothesis at the 5\% level. You can also see this from the histogram above that we are far into the left tail of the null distribution.

\hypertarget{bootstrapping-for-confidence-interval-4}{%
\subsubsection*{Bootstrapping for confidence interval}\label{bootstrapping-for-confidence-interval-4}}


We can also create a confidence interval for the unknown population parameter \(\mu_{diff}\) using our sample data (the calculated differences) with \emph{bootstrapping}. This is similar to the bootstrapping done in a one sample mean case, except now our data is differences instead of raw numerical data.
Note that this code is identical to the pipeline shown in the hypothesis test above except the \texttt{hypothesize()} function is not called.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ismaykim_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-490-1} \end{center}

We see that 0 is not contained in this confidence interval as a plausible value of \(\mu_{diff}\) (the unknown population parameter). This matches with our hypothesis test results of rejecting the null hypothesis. Since zero is not a plausible value of the population parameter and since the entire confidence interval falls below zero, we have evidence that surface zinc concentration levels are lower, on average, than bottom level zinc concentrations.

\textbf{Interpretation}: We are 95\% confident the true mean zinc concentration on the surface is between 0.11 units smaller to 0.05 units smaller than on the bottom.

\hypertarget{check-conditions-4}{%
\subsubsection*{Check conditions}\label{check-conditions-4}}


Remember that in order to use the shortcut (formula-based, theoretical) approach, we need to check that some conditions are met.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Independent observations}: The observations among pairs are independent.

  The locations are selected independently through random sampling so this condition is met.
\item
  \emph{Approximately normal}: The distribution of population of differences is normal or the number of pairs is at least 30.

  The histogram above does show some skew so we have reason to doubt the population being normal based on this sample. We also only have 10 pairs which is fewer than the 30 needed. A theory-based test may not be valid here.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{test-statistic-4}{%
\subsubsection*{Test statistic}\label{test-statistic-4}}


The test statistic is a random variable based on the sample data. Here, we want to look at a way to estimate the population mean difference \(\mu_{diff}\). A good guess is the sample mean difference \(\bar{X}_{diff}\). Recall that this sample mean is actually a random variable that will vary as different samples are (theoretically, would be) collected. We are looking to see how likely is it for us to have observed a sample mean of \(\bar{x}_{diff, obs} = 0.0804\) or larger assuming that the population mean difference is 0 (assuming the null hypothesis is true). If the conditions are met and assuming \(H_0\) is true, we can ``standardize'' this original test statistic of \(\bar{X}_{diff}\) into a \(T\) statistic that follows a \(t\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \(df = n - 1\):

\[ T =\dfrac{ \bar{X}_{diff} - 0}{ S_{diff} / \sqrt{n} } \sim t (df = n - 1) \]

where \(S\) represents the standard deviation of the sample differences and \(n\) is the number of pairs.

\hypertarget{observed-test-statistic-4}{%
\paragraph{Observed test statistic}\label{observed-test-statistic-4}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Observed test statistic}

While one could compute this observed test statistic by ``hand'', the focus here is on the set-up of the problem and in understanding which formula for the test statistic applies. We can use the \texttt{t\_test} function on the differences to perform this analysis for us.

\begin{Shaded}

\hypertarget{compute-p-value-2}{%
\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{Compute \(p\)-value}{Compute p-value}}\label{compute-p-value-2}}


The \(p\)-value---the probability of observing a \(t_{obs}\) value of -4.864 or less in our null distribution of a \(t\) with 9 degrees of freedom---is 0. This can also be calculated in R directly:

\hypertarget{state-conclusion-4}{%
\subsubsection*{State conclusion}\label{state-conclusion-4}}


We, therefore, have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Our initial guess that our observed sample mean difference was not statistically less than the hypothesized mean of 0 has been invalidated here. Based on this sample, we have evidence that the mean concentration in the bottom water is greater than that of the surface water at different paired locations.

\hypertarget{comparing-results-4}{%
\subsection{Comparing results}\label{comparing-results-4}}

Observing the bootstrap distribution and the null distribution that were created, it makes quite a bit of sense that the results are so similar for traditional and non-traditional methods in terms of the \(p\)-value and the confidence interval since these distributions look very similar to normal distributions. The conditions were not met since the number of pairs was small, but the sample data was not highly skewed. Using any of the methods whether they are traditional (formula-based) or non-traditional (computational-based) lead to similar results here.

It is often preferred for barplots to be ordered corresponding to the heights of the bars. This allows the reader to more easily compare the ordering of different airlines in terms of departed flights \citep{robbins2013}. We can also much more easily answer questions like ``How many airlines have more departing flights than Southwest Airlines?''.

Another useful tool for viewing linegraphs such as this is the \texttt{dygraph} function in the \texttt{dygraphs} package in combination with the \texttt{dyRangeSelector} function. This allows us to zoom in on a selected range and get an interactive plot for us to work with:

The syntax here is a little different than what we have covered so far. The \texttt{dygraph} function is expecting for the dates to be given as the \texttt{rownames} of the object. We then remove the \texttt{date} variable from the \texttt{flights\_summarized} data frame since it is accounted for in the \texttt{rownames}. Lastly, we run the \texttt{dygraph} function on the new data frame that only contains the median arrival delay as a column and then provide the ability to have a selector to zoom in on the interactive plot via \texttt{dyRangeSelector}. (Note that this plot will only be interactive in the HTML version of this book.)

\textbf{(LC2.1)} Repeat the above installing steps, but for the \texttt{dplyr}, \texttt{nycflights13}, and \texttt{knitr} packages. This will install the earlier mentioned \texttt{dplyr} package, the \texttt{nycflights13} package containing data on all domestic flights leaving a NYC airport in 2013, and the \texttt{knitr} package for writing reports in R.

\textbf{(LC2.2)} ``Load'' the \texttt{dplyr}, \texttt{nycflights13}, and \texttt{knitr} packages as well by repeating the above steps.

\textbf{Solution}: If the following code runs with no errors, you've succeeded!

\tightlist
\item
  A. Data on an airline
\item
  B. Data on a flight
\item
  C. Data on an airport
\item
  D. Data on multiple flights
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Solution}: This is data on a flight. Not a flight path! Example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a flight path would be United 1545 to Houston
\item
  a flight would be United 1545 to Houston at a specific date/time. For example: 2013/1/1 at 5:15am.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{(LC2.4)} What are some examples in this dataset of \textbf{categorical} variables? What makes them different than \textbf{quantitative} variables?

\textbf{Solution}: Hint: Type \texttt{?flights} in the console to see what all the variables mean!

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Categorical:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{carrier} the company
  \item
    \texttt{dest} the destination
  \item
    \texttt{flight} the flight number. Even though this is a number, its simply a label. Example United 1545 is not less than United 1714
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Quantitative:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{distance} the distance in miles
  \item
    \texttt{time\_hour} time
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{(LC2.5)} What does \texttt{int}, \texttt{dbl}, and \texttt{chr} mean in the output above?

\textbf{Solution}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{int}: integer. Used to count things i.e.~a discrete value. Ex: the \# of cars parked in a lot
\item
  \texttt{dbl}: double. Used to measure things. i.e.~a continuous value. Ex: your height in inches
\item
  \texttt{chr}: character. i.e.~text
\end{itemize}

\textbf{(LC2.6)} What properties of the observational unit do each of \texttt{lat}, \texttt{lon}, \texttt{alt}, \texttt{tz}, \texttt{dst}, and \texttt{tzone} describe for the \texttt{airports} data frame? Note that you may want to use \texttt{?airports} to get more information.

\textbf{Solution}: \texttt{lat} \texttt{long} represent the airport geographic coordinates, \texttt{alt} is the altitude above sea level of the airport (Run \texttt{airports\ \%\textgreater{}\%\ filter(faa\ ==\ "DEN")} to see the altitude of Denver International Airport), \texttt{tz} is the time zone difference with respect to GMT in London UK, \texttt{dst} is the daylight savings time zone, and \texttt{tzone} is the time zone label.

\textbf{(LC2.7)} Provide the names of variables in a data frame with at least three variables in which one of them is an identification variable and the other two are not. In other words, create your own tidy dataset that matches these conditions.

\textbf{Solution}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the \texttt{weather} example in LC3.8, the combination of \texttt{origin}, \texttt{year}, \texttt{month}, \texttt{day}, \texttt{hour} are identification variables as they identify the observation in question.
\item
  Anything else pertains to observations: \texttt{temp}, \texttt{humid}, \texttt{wind\_speed}, etc.

\textbf{Solution}: \texttt{flights} contains all flight data, while \texttt{alaska\_flights} contains only data from Alaskan carrier ``AS''. We can see that flights has 336776 rows while \texttt{alaska\_flights} has only 714

\textbf{(LC3.2)} What are some practical reasons why \texttt{dep\_delay} and \texttt{arr\_delay} have a positive relationship?

\textbf{Solution}: The later a plane departs, typically the later it will arrive.

\textbf{(LC3.3)} What variables (not necessarily in the \texttt{flights} data frame) would you expect to have a negative correlation (i.e.~a negative relationship) with \texttt{dep\_delay}? Why? Remember that we are focusing on numerical variables here.

\textbf{Solution}: An example in the \texttt{weather} dataset is \texttt{visibility}, which measure visibility in miles. As visibility increases, we would expect departure delays to decrease.

\textbf{(LC3.4)} Why do you believe there is a cluster of points near (0, 0)? What does (0, 0) correspond to in terms of the Alaskan flights?

\textbf{Solution}: The point (0,0) means no delay in departure nor arrival. From the point of view of Alaska airlines, this means the flight was on time. It seems most flights are at least close to being on time.

\textbf{(LC3.5)} What are some other features of the plot that stand out to you?

\textbf{Solution}: Different people will answer this one differently. One answer is most flights depart and arrive less than an hour late.

\textbf{(LC3.6)} Create a new scatterplot using different variables in the \texttt{alaska\_flights} data frame by modifying the example above.

\textbf{Solution}: Many possibilities for this one, see the plot below. Is there a pattern in departure delay depending on when the flight is scheduled to depart? Interestingly, there seems to be only two blocks of time where flights depart.

\textbf{(LC3.7)} Why is setting the \texttt{alpha} argument value useful with scatterplots? What further information does it give you that a regular scatterplot cannot?

\textbf{Solution}: Why is setting the \texttt{alpha} argument value useful with scatterplots? What further information does it give you that a regular scatterplot cannot? \emph{It thins out the points so we address overplotting. But more importantly it hints at the (statistical) \textbf{density} and \textbf{distribution} of the points: where are the points concentrated, where do they occur. We will see more about densities and distributions in Chapter 6 when we switch gears to statistical topics.}

\textbf{(LC3.8)} After viewing the Figure \ref{fig:alpha} above, give an approximate range of arrival delays and departure delays that occur the most frequently. How has that region changed compared to when you observed the same plot without the \texttt{alpha\ =\ 0.2} set in Figure \ref{fig:noalpha}?

\textbf{Solution}: After viewing the Figure \ref{fig:alpha} above, give a range of arrival delays and departure delays that occur most frequently? How has that region changed compared to when you observed the same plot without the \texttt{alpha\ =\ 0.2} set in Figure \ref{fig:noalpha}? \emph{The lower plot suggests that most Alaska flights from NYC depart between 12 minutes early and on time and arrive between 50 minutes early and on time.}

\textbf{(LC3.9)} Take a look at both the \texttt{weather} and \texttt{early\_january\_weather} data frames by running \texttt{View(weather)} and \texttt{View(early\_january\_weather)} in the console. In what respect do these data frames differ?

\textbf{Solution}: Take a look at both the \texttt{weather} and \texttt{early\_january\_weather} data frames by running \texttt{View(weather)} and \texttt{View(early\_january\_weather)} in the console. In what respect do these data frames differ? \emph{The rows of \texttt{early\_january\_weather} are a subset of \texttt{weather}.}

\textbf{(LC3.10)} \texttt{View()} the \texttt{flights} data frame again. Why does the \texttt{time\_hour} variable uniquely identify the hour of the measurement whereas the \texttt{hour} variable does not?

\textbf{Solution}: \texttt{View()} the \texttt{flights} data frame again. Why does the \texttt{time\_hour} variable correctly identify the hour of the measurement whereas the \texttt{hour} variable does not? \emph{Because to uniquely identify an hour, we need the \texttt{year}/\texttt{month}/\texttt{day}/\texttt{hour} sequence, whereas there are only 24 possible \texttt{hour}'s.}

\textbf{(LC3.11)} Why should linegraphs be avoided when there is not a clear ordering of the horizontal axis?

\textbf{Solution}: Why should linegraphs be avoided when there is not a clear ordering of the horizontal axis? \emph{Because lines suggest connectedness and ordering.}

\textbf{(LC3.12)} Why are linegraphs frequently used when time is the explanatory variable?

\textbf{Solution}: Why are linegraphs frequently used when time is the explanatory variable? \emph{Because time is sequential: subsequent observations are closely related to each other.}

\textbf{(LC3.13)} Plot a time series of a variable other than \texttt{temp} for Newark Airport in the first 15 days of January 2013.

\textbf{Solution}: Plot a time series of a variable other than \texttt{temp} for Newark Airport in the first 15 days of January 2013. \emph{Humidity is a good one to look at, since this very closely related to the cycles of a day.}

\textbf{(LC3.14)} What does changing the number of bins from 30 to 40 tell us about the distribution of temperatures?

\textbf{Solution}: The distribution doesn't change much. But by refining the bin width, we see that the temperature data has a high degree of accuracy. What do I mean by accuracy? Looking at the \texttt{temp} variabile by \texttt{View(weather)}, we see that the precision of each temperature recording is 2 decimal places.

\textbf{(LC3.15)} Would you classify the distribution of temperatures as symmetric or skewed?

\textbf{Solution}: It is rather symmetric, i.e.~there are no \textbf{long tails} on only one side of the distribution

\textbf{(LC3.16)} What would you guess is the ``center'' value in this distribution? Why did you make that choice?

\textbf{Solution}: The center is around 55.26°F. By running the \texttt{summary()} command, we see that the mean and median are very similar. In fact, when the distribution is symmetric the mean equals the median.

\textbf{(LC3.17)} Is this data spread out greatly from the center or is it close? Why?

\textbf{Solution}: This can only be answered relatively speaking! Let's pick things to be relative to Seattle, WA temperatures:

\includegraphics{images/temp.png}

While, it appears that Seattle weather has a similar center of 55°F, its
temperatures are almost entirely between 35°F and 75°F for a range of
about 40°F. Seattle temperatures are much less spread out than New York
i.e.~much more consistent over the year. New York on the other hand has much colder
days in the winter and much hotter days in the summer. Expressed differently,
the middle 50\% of values, as delineated by the interquartile range is 30°F:

\textbf{(LC3.18)} What other things do you notice about the faceted plot above? How does a faceted plot help us see relationships between two variables?

\textbf{Solution}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Certain months have much more consistent weather (August in particular), while others have crazy variability like January and October, representing changes in the seasons.
\item
  Because we see \texttt{temp} recordings split by \texttt{month}, we are considering the relationship between these two variables. For example, for example for summer months, temperatures tend to be higher.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{(LC3.19)} What do the numbers 1-12 correspond to in the plot above? What about 25, 50, 75, 100?

\textbf{Solution}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  While month is technically a number between 1-12, we're viewing it as a categorical variable here. Specifically an \textbf{ordinal categorical} variable since there is a ordering to the categories
\item
  25, 50, 75, 100 are temperatures
\end{itemize}

\textbf{(LC3.20)} For which types of data-sets would these types of faceted plots not work well in comparing relationships between variables? Give an example describing the nature of these variables and other important characteristics.

\textbf{Solution}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We'd have 365 facets to look at. Way too many.
\item
  We don't really care about day-to-day fluctuation in weather so much, but maybe more week-to-week variation. We'd like to focus on seasonal trends.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{(LC3.21)} Does the \texttt{temp} variable in the \texttt{weather} data-set have a lot of variability? Why do you say that?

\textbf{Solution}: Again, like in LC (LC3.17), this is a relative question. I would say yes, because in New York City, you have 4 clear seasons with different weather. Whereas in Seattle WA and Portland OR, you have two seasons: summer and rain!

\textbf{(LC3.22)} What does the dot at the bottom of the plot for May correspond to? Explain what might have occurred in May to produce this point.

\textbf{Solution}: It appears to be an outlier. Let's revisit the use of the \texttt{filter} command to hone in on it. We want all data points where the \texttt{month} is 5 and \texttt{temp\textless{}25}

\begin{Shaded}

#   precip <dbl>, pressure <dbl>, visib <dbl>, time_hour <dttm>,
#   temp_in_C <dbl>
\end{verbatim}

There appears to be only one hour and only at JFK that recorded 13.1 F (-10.5 C) in the month of May. This is probably a data entry mistake! Why wasn't the weather at least similar at EWR (Newark) and LGA (La Guardia)?

\textbf{(LC3.23)} Which months have the highest variability in temperature? What reasons do you think this is?

\textbf{Solution}: We are now interested in the \textbf{spread} of the data. One measure some of you may have seen previously is the standard deviation. But in this plot we can read off the Interquartile Range (IQR):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The distance from the 1st to the 3rd quartiles i.e.~the length of the boxes
\item
  You can also think of this as the spread of the \textbf{middle 50\%} of the data
\end{itemize}

Just from eyeballing it, it seems

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  November has the biggest IQR, i.e.~the widest box, so has the most variation in temperature
\item
  August has the smallest IQR, i.e.~the narrowest box, so is the most consistent temperature-wise
\end{itemize}

Here's how we compute the exact IQR values for each month (we'll see this more in depth Chapter 5 of the text):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{group} the observations by \texttt{month} then
\item
  for each \texttt{group}, i.e. \texttt{month}, \texttt{summarize} it by applying the summary statistic function \texttt{IQR()}, while making sure to skip over missing data via \texttt{na.rm=TRUE} then
\item
  \texttt{arrange} the table in \texttt{desc}ending order of \texttt{IQR}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{(LC3.24)} We looked at the distribution of the numerical variable \texttt{temp} split by the numerical variable \texttt{month} that we converted to a categorical variable using the \texttt{factor()} function. Why would a boxplot of \texttt{temp} split by the numerical variable \texttt{pressure} similarly converted to a categorical variable using the \texttt{factor()} not be informative?

\textbf{Solution}: Because there are 12 unique values of \texttt{month} yielding only 12 boxes in our boxplot. There are many more unique values of \texttt{pressure} (469 unique values in fact), because values are to the first decimal place. This would lead to 469 boxes, which is too many for people to digest.

\textbf{(LC3.25)} Boxplots provide a simple way to identify outliers. Why may outliers be easier to identify when looking at a boxplot instead of a faceted histogram?

\textbf{Solution}: In a histogram, the bin corresponding to where an outlier lies may not by high enough for us to see. In a boxplot, they are explicitly labelled separately.

\textbf{(LC3.26)} Why are histograms inappropriate for visualizing categorical variables?

\textbf{Solution}: Histograms are for numerical variables i.e.~the horizontal part of each histogram bar represents an interval, whereas for a categorical variable each bar represents only one level of the categorical variable.

\textbf{(LC3.27)} What is the difference between histograms and barplots?

\textbf{Solution}: See above.

\textbf{(LC3.28)} How many Envoy Air flights departed NYC in 2013?

\textbf{Solution}: Envoy Air is carrier code \texttt{MQ} and thus 26397 flights departed NYC in 2013.

\textbf{(LC3.29)} What was the seventh highest airline in terms of departed flights from NYC in 2013? How could we better present the table to get this answer quickly?

\textbf{Solution}: What a pain! We'll see in Chapter 5 on Data Wrangling that applying \texttt{arrange(desc(n))} will sort this table in descending order of \texttt{n}!

\textbf{(LC3.30)} Why should pie charts be avoided and replaced by barplots?

\textbf{Solution}: In our \textbf{opinion}, comparisons using horizontal lines are easier than comparing angles and areas of circles.

\textbf{(LC3.31)} What is your opinion as to why pie charts continue to be used?

\textbf{Solution}: Legacy?

\textbf{(LC3.32)} What kinds of questions are not easily answered by looking at the above figure?

\textbf{Solution}: Because the red, green, and blue bars don't all start at 0 (only red does), it makes comparing counts hard.

\textbf{(LC3.33)} What can you say, if anything, about the relationship between airline and airport in NYC in 2013 in regards to the number of departing flights?

\textbf{Solution}: The different airlines prefer different airports. For example, United is mostly a Newark carrier and JetBlue is a JFK carrier. If airlines didn't prefer airports, each color would be roughly one third of each bar.\}

\textbf{(LC3.34)} Why might the side-by-side (AKA dodged) barplot be preferable to a stacked barplot in this case?

\textbf{Solution}: We can easily compare the different aiports for a given carrier using a single comparison line i.e.~things are lined up

\textbf{(LC3.35)} What are the disadvantages of using a side-by-side (AKA dodged) barplot, in general?

\textbf{Solution}: It is hard to get totals for each airline.

\textbf{(LC3.36)} Why is the faceted barplot preferred to the side-by-side and stacked barplots in this case?

\textbf{Solution}: Not that different than using side-by-side; depends on how you want to organize your presentation.

\textbf{(LC3.37)} What information about the different carriers at different airports is more easily seen in the faceted barplot?

\textbf{Solution}: Now we can also compare the different carriers \textbf{within} a particular airport easily too. For example, we can read off who the top carrier for each airport is easily using a single horizontal line.

\textbf{(LC4.2)} Say a doctor is studying the effect of smoking on lung cancer for a large number of patients who have records measured at five year intervals. She notices that a large number of patients have missing data points because the patient has died, so she chooses to ignore these patients in her analysis. What is wrong with this doctor's approach?

\textbf{Solution}: The missing patients may have died of lung cancer! So to ignore them might seriously \textbf{bias} your results! It is very important to think of what the consequences on your analysis are of ignoring missing data! Ask yourself:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There is a systematic reasons why certain values are missing? If so, you might be biasing your results!
\item
  If there isn't, then it might be ok to ``sweep missing values under the rug.''
\end{itemize}

\textbf{(LC4.3)} Modify the above \texttt{summarize} function to create \texttt{summary\_temp} to also use the \texttt{n()} summary function: \texttt{summarize(count\ =\ n())}. What does the returned value correspond to?

\textbf{Solution}: It corresponds to a count of the number of observations/rows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{weather }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{count =} \KeywordTok{n}\NormalTok{())}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  count
  <int>
1 26115
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{(LC4.4)} Why doesn't the following code work? Run the code line by line instead of all at once, and then look at the data. In other words, run \texttt{summary\_temp\ \textless{}-\ weather\ \%\textgreater{}\%\ summarize(mean\ =\ mean(temp,\ na.rm\ =\ TRUE))} first.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{std_dev =} \KeywordTok{sd}\NormalTok{(temp, }\DataTypeTok{na.rm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Solution}: Consider the output of only running the first two lines:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{weather }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{   }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{mean =} \KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(temp, }\DataTypeTok{na.rm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 1 x 1
   mean
  <dbl>
1  55.3
\end{verbatim}

Because after the first \texttt{summarize()}, the variable \texttt{temp} disappears as it has been collapsed to the value \texttt{mean}. So when we try to run the second \texttt{summarize()}, it can't find the variable \texttt{temp} to compute the standard deviation of.

\textbf{(LC4.5)} Recall from Chapter \ref{viz} when we looked at plots of temperatures by months in NYC. What does the standard deviation column in the \texttt{summary\_monthly\_temp} data frame tell us about temperatures in New York City throughout the year?

\textbf{Solution}:

The standard deviation is a quantification of \textbf{spread} and \textbf{variability}. We
see that the period in November, December, and January has the most variation in
weather, so you can expect very different temperatures on different days.

\textbf{(LC4.6)} What code would be required to get the mean and standard deviation temperature for each day in 2013 for NYC?

\textbf{Solution}:

Note: \texttt{group\_by(day)} is not enough, because \texttt{day} is a value between 1-31. We need to \texttt{group\_by(year,\ month,\ day)}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\textbf{(LC4.7)} Recreate \texttt{by\_monthly\_origin}, but instead of grouping via \texttt{group\_by(origin,\ month)}, group variables in a different order \texttt{group\_by(month,\ origin)}. What differs in the resulting dataset?

\textbf{Solution}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{by_monthly_origin}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In \texttt{by\_monthly\_origin} the \texttt{month} column is now first and the rows are sorted by \texttt{month} instead of origin. If you compare the values of \texttt{count} in \texttt{by\_origin\_monthly} and \texttt{by\_monthly\_origin} using the \texttt{View()} function, you'll see that the values are actually the same, just presented in a different order.

\textbf{(LC4.8)} How could we identify how many flights left each of the three airports for each \texttt{carrier}?

\textbf{Solution}: We could summarize the count from each airport using the \texttt{n()} function, which \emph{counts rows}.

All remarkably similar! Note: the \texttt{n()} function counts rows, whereas the \texttt{sum(VARIABLE\_NAME)} funciton sums all values of a certain numerical variable \texttt{VARIABLE\_NAME}.

\textbf{(LC4.9)} How does the \texttt{filter} operation differ from a \texttt{group\_by} followed by a \texttt{summarize}?

\textbf{Solution}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{filter} picks out rows from the original dataset without modifying them, whereas
\item
  \texttt{group\_by\ \%\textgreater{}\%\ summarize} computes summaries of numerical variables, and hence
  reports new values.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{(LC4.10)} What do positive values of the \texttt{gain} variable in \texttt{flights} correspond to? What about negative values? And what about a zero value?

\textbf{Solution}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Say a flight departed 20 minutes late, i.e. \texttt{dep\_delay\ =\ 20}
\item
  Then arrived 10 minutes late, i.e. \texttt{arr\_delay\ =\ 10}.
\item
  Then \texttt{gain\ =\ dep\_delay\ -\ arr\_delay\ =\ 20\ -\ 10\ \ =\ 10} is positive, so it ``made up/gained time in the air.''
\item
  0 means the departure and arrival time were the same, so no time was made up in the air. We see in most cases that the \texttt{gain} is near 0 minutes.
\item
  I never understood this. If the pilot says ``we're going make up time in the air''
  because of delay by flying faster, why don't you always just fly faster to begin
  with?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{(LC4.11)} Could we create the \texttt{dep\_delay} and \texttt{arr\_delay} columns by simply subtracting \texttt{dep\_time} from \texttt{sched\_dep\_time} and similarly for arrivals? Try the code out and explain any differences between the result and what actually appears in \texttt{flights}.

\textbf{Solution}: No because you can't do direct arithmetic on times. The difference in time between 12:03 and 11:59 is 4 minutes, but \texttt{1203-1159\ =\ 44}

\textbf{(LC4.12)} What can we say about the distribution of \texttt{gain}? Describe it in a few sentences using the plot and the \texttt{gain\_summary} data frame values.

\textbf{Solution}: Most of the time the gain is a little under zero, most of the time the gain is between -50 and 50 minutes. There are some extreme cases however!

\textbf{(LC4.13)} Looking at Figure \ref{fig:reldiagram}, when joining \texttt{flights} and \texttt{weather} (or, in other words, matching the hourly weather values with each flight), why do we need to join by all of \texttt{year}, \texttt{month}, \texttt{day}, \texttt{hour}, and \texttt{origin}, and not just \texttt{hour}?

\textbf{Solution}: Because \texttt{hour} is simply a value between 0 and 23; to identify a \emph{specific} hour, we need to know which year, month, day and at which airport.

\textbf{(LC4.14)} What surprises you about the top 10 destinations from NYC in 2013?

\textbf{Solution}: This question is subjective! What surprises me is the high number of flights to Boston. Wouldn't it be easier and quicker to take the train?

\textbf{(LC4.15)} What are some advantages of data in normal forms? What are some disadvantages?

\textbf{Solution}: When datasets are in normal form, we can easily \texttt{\_join} them with other datasets! For example, we can join the \texttt{flights} data with the \texttt{planes} data.

\textbf{(LC4.16)} What are some ways to select all three of the \texttt{dest}, \texttt{air\_time}, and \texttt{distance} variables from \texttt{flights}? Give the code showing how to do this in at least three different ways.

\textbf{Solution}:

\textbf{(LC4.17)} How could one use \texttt{starts\_with}, \texttt{ends\_with}, and \texttt{contains} to select columns from the \texttt{flights} data frame? Provide three different examples in total: one for \texttt{starts\_with}, one for \texttt{ends\_with}, and one for \texttt{contains}.

\textbf{Solution}:

\textbf{(LC4.18)} Why might we want to use the \texttt{select()} function on a data frame?

\textbf{Solution}: To narrow down the data frame, to make it easier to look at. Using \texttt{View()} for example.

\textbf{(LC4.19)} Create a new data frame that shows the top 5 airports with the largest arrival delays from NYC in 2013.

\textbf{Solution}:

\textbf{(LC4.20)} Using the datasets included in the \texttt{nycflights13} package, compute the available seat miles for each airline sorted in descending order. After completing all the necessary data wrangling steps, the resulting data frame should have 16 rows (one for each airline) and 2 columns (airline name and available seat miles). Here are some hints:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Crucial}: Unless you are very confident in what you are doing, it is worthwhile to not starting coding right away, but rather first sketch out on paper all the necessary data wrangling steps not using exact code, but rather high-level \emph{pseudocode} that is informal yet detailed enough to articulate what you are doing. This way you won't confuse \emph{what} you are trying to do (the algorithm) with \emph{how} you are going to do it (writing \texttt{dplyr} code).
\item
  Take a close look at all the datasets using the \texttt{View()} function: \texttt{flights}, \texttt{weather}, \texttt{planes}, \texttt{airports}, and \texttt{airlines} to identify which variables are necessary to compute available seat miles.
\item
  Figure \ref{fig:reldiagram} above showing how the various datasets can be joined will also be useful.
\item
  Consider the data wrangling verbs in Table \ref{tab:wrangle-summary-table} as your toolbox!
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solution}: Here are some examples of student-written \href{https://twitter.com/rudeboybert/status/964181298691629056}{pseudocode}. Based on our own pseudocode, let's first display the entire solution.

Let's now break this down step-by-step. To compute the available seat miles for a given flight, we need the \texttt{distance} variable from the \texttt{flights} data frame and the \texttt{seats} variable from the \texttt{planes} data frame, necessitating a join by the key variable \texttt{tailnum} as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:reldiagram}. To keep the resulting data frame easy to view, we'll \texttt{select()} only these two variables and \texttt{carrier}:

Now for each flight we can compute the available seat miles \texttt{ASM} by multiplying the number of seats by the distance via a \texttt{mutate()}:

Next we want to sum the \texttt{ASM} for each carrier. We achieve this by first grouping by \texttt{carrier} and then summarizing using the \texttt{sum()} function:

However, because for certain carriers certain flights have missing \texttt{NA} values, the resulting table also returns \texttt{NA}'s. We can eliminate these by adding a \texttt{na.rm\ =\ TRUE} argument to \texttt{sum()}, telling R that we want to remove the \texttt{NA}'s in the sum. We saw this in Section \ref{summarize}:

Finally, we \texttt{arrange()} the data in \texttt{desc()}ending order of \texttt{ASM}.

While the above data frame is correct, the IATA \texttt{carrier} code is not always useful. For example, what carrier is \texttt{WN}? We can address this by joining with the \texttt{airlines} dataset using \texttt{carrier} is the key variable. While this step is not absolutely required, it goes a long way to making the table easier to make sense of. It is important to be empathetic with the ultimate consumers of your presented data!

\textbf{(LC5.1)} What are common characteristics of ``tidy'' datasets?

\textbf{Solution}: Rows correspond to observations, while columns correspond to variables.

\textbf{(LC5.2)} What makes ``tidy'' datasets useful for organizing data?

\textbf{Solution}: Tidy datasets are an organized way of viewing data. This format is required for the \texttt{ggplot2} and \texttt{dplyr} packages for data visualization and wrangling.

\textbf{(LC5.3)} Take a look the \texttt{airline\_safety} data frame included in the \texttt{fivethirtyeight} data. Run the following:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{airline_safety}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

After reading the help file by running \texttt{?airline\_safety}, we see that \texttt{airline\_safety} is a data frame containing information on different airlines companies' safety records. This data was originally reported on the data journalism website FiveThirtyEight.com in Nate Silver's article \href{https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-travelers-avoid-flying-airlines-that-have-had-crashes-in-the-past/}{``Should Travelers Avoid Flying Airlines That Have Had Crashes in the Past?''}. Let's ignore the \texttt{incl\_reg\_subsidiaries} and \texttt{avail\_seat\_km\_per\_week} variables for simplicity:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{airline_safety_smaller <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{airline_safety }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{-}\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(incl_reg_subsidiaries, avail_seat_km_per_week))}
\NormalTok{airline_safety_smaller}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 56 x 7
   airline incidents_85_99 fatal_accidents~ fatalities_85_99

#   incidents_00_14 <int>, fatal_accidents_00_14 <int>,
#   fatalities_00_14 <int>
\end{verbatim}

This data frame is not in ``tidy'' format. How would you convert this data frame to be in ``tidy'' format, in particular so that it has a variable \texttt{incident\_type\_years} indicating the indicent type/year and a variable \texttt{count} of the counts?

\textbf{Solution}: Using the \texttt{gather()} function from the \texttt{tidyr} package:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{airline_safety_smaller_tidy <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{airline_safety_smaller }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{gather}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{key =}\NormalTok{ incident_type_years, }\DataTypeTok{value =}\NormalTok{ count, }\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{airline)}
\NormalTok{airline_safety_smaller_tidy}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 336 x 3
   airline               incident_type_years count
   <chr>                 <chr>               <int>
 1 Aer Lingus            incidents_85_99         2
 2 Aeroflot              incidents_85_99        76
 3 Aerolineas Argentinas incidents_85_99         6
 4 Aeromexico            incidents_85_99         3
 5 Air Canada            incidents_85_99         2
 6 Air France            incidents_85_99        14
 7 Air India             incidents_85_99         2
 8 Air New Zealand       incidents_85_99         3
 9 Alaska Airlines       incidents_85_99         5
10 Alitalia              incidents_85_99         7
# ... with 326 more rows
\end{verbatim}

If you look at the resulting \texttt{airline\_safety\_smaller\_tidy} data frame in the spreadsheet viewer, you'll see that the variable \texttt{incident\_type\_years} has 6 possible values: \texttt{"incidents\_85\_99",\ "fatal\_accidents\_85\_99",\ "fatalities\_85\_99",\ \ "incidents\_00\_14",\ "fatal\_accidents\_00\_14",\ "fatalities\_00\_14"} corresponding to the 6 columns of \texttt{airline\_safety\_smaller} we tidied.

\textbf{(LC5.4)} Convert the \texttt{dem\_score} data frame into
a tidy data frame and assign the name of \texttt{dem\_score\_tidy} to the resulting long-formatted data frame.

\textbf{Solution}: Running the following in the console:

Let's now compare the \texttt{dem\_score} and \texttt{dem\_score\_tidy}. \texttt{dem\_score} has democracy score information for each year in columns, whereas in \texttt{dem\_score\_tidy} there are explicit variables \texttt{year} and \texttt{democracy\_score}. While both representations of the data contain the same information, we can only use \texttt{ggplot()} to create plots using the \texttt{dem\_score\_tidy} data frame.

\textbf{(LC5.5)} Read in the life expectancy data stored at \url{https://moderndive.com/data/le_mess.csv} and convert it to a tidy data frame.

\textbf{Solution}: The code is similar

We observe the same construct structure with respect to \texttt{year} in \texttt{life\_expectancy} vs \texttt{life\_expectancy\_tidy} as we did in \texttt{dem\_score} vs \texttt{dem\_score\_tidy}:
